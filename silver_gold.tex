\section{surface Ullmann coupling on other coinage surface}
We have also investigated surface Ullmann coupling of bromobenzene of Ag(111) and Au(111) surfaces other than Cu(111). Ag(111) and Au(111) are modeled in the same procedure as Cu(111), 4 layers (each layer contains 48 atoms) with 20 \SI{20}{\angstrom} slab is built and optimized.
