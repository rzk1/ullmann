abstract = "The chemistry of iodobenzene on a Cu(111) surface has been studied by Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), temperature-programmed reaction (TPR) spectroscopy, and work function change measurements. The results from these techniques and from H atom titration experiments show that iodobenzene dissociates at 175 K to form phenyl groups and iodine atoms and that the phenyl groups are thermally stable to above 300 K. The HREELS spectral intensities indicate that these phenyl groups bond with their π-rings approximately parallel to the surface plane. A possible reason for this unexpected adsorption geometry is the formation of phenyl anions. Biphenyl, formed by coupling of the phenyl groups, is evolved at temperatures above 300 K, while the iodine remains adsorbed on the surface until temperatures above 900 K. Comparison of the biphenyl evolution rate after iodobenzene adsorption with the rate after biphenyl adsorption indicates that phenyl coupling as opposed to biphenyl desorption is the rate-determining step in yielding biphenyl from adsorbed phenyl groups. Factors affecting the coupling rate are discussed."

abstract = {Abstract Possible origins of the formation of organometallic intermediates in on-surface Ullmann couplings have been investigated by surface tunneling microscopy (STM) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We consider the case of iodobenzenes on the coinage metals copper, silver, and gold. We found experimental evidence for the formation of surface vacancies and the presence of metal adatoms in these coupling reactions, which are taken as a hint for the reactive extraction of surface atoms by adsorbates. In a second step, we demonstrate by ab initio molecular dynamics calculations for aryl–iodides on copper that metal atoms can be pulled out of the surface to form metal-organic species. By contrast, a thermally activated provision of a metal atom from the surface to form an adatom is energetically unfavorable. Finally, we investigate the mechanism and energetics of the reactive extraction of surface metal atoms by means of (climbing-image) nudged elastic band density-functional theory calculations for iodobenzene on copper, silver, and gold, and analyze our results in the light of the experimental findings.},

abstract  ="The coupling process of phenyl radicals—the important intermediates in the prototypal Ullmann reaction—on Cu(111) is addressed using density functional theory. Consistent with experiments{,} we prove that the fragments interact attractively already at relatively large distances. An intermediate state involving a “popping-out” surface atom is reached through a non-trivial surface diffusion path. The overall process of coupling to the final biphenyl state (with a barrier of 0.38 eV) is governed by a subtle electronic mechanism that reminds the concepts postulated by Hoffmann about the alignment of molecular frontier orbitals with the metallic Fermi level. Our results can be applied to more complex surface processes in the field of molecular self-assembly."}

At 105 K iodobenzene adsorbs molecularly. Submonolayer coverages of iodobenzene dissociate to form iodine atoms and phenyl groups on the surface. The I atoms desorb in a broad peak near 800 K, and the phenyl groups recombine to form biphenyl that desorbs in a broad peak near 370 K. Monolayer iodobenzene desorbs at 197 K, and the multilayer desorbs at 175 K. Pulsed-laser excitation of one monolayer (ML) of iodobenzene with 248 and 351 nm light results in CI bond cleavage and retention of iodine and phenyl fragments on the surface. For coverages greater than 2 ML, pulsed excitation with 248 nm light leads to phenyl radical and iodine atom ejection into the gas phase. The TOF spectra for the iodine and phenyl photofragments were fit with two components. The calculated translational temperatures of the two atomic iodine components were 3350 ± 150 K and 1300 ± 130 K. The calculated translational temperature of the two phenyl components was 4050 ± 200 K and 2050 ± 200 K. In multilayers, iodobiphenyl, biphenyl and benzene were produced in photo-induced bimolecular reactions."

We investigated the possibility of using the thermal dissociation of iodobenzene (C6H5I) as a method for generating chemisorbed phenyl groups bound to Au(111) surfaces. Iodobenzene desorbs molecularly in three peaks at 290–308, 212 and 188 K in temperature programmed description (TPD) and partially decomposes at 200–250 K to form coadsorbed biphenyl and iodine on the surface. Biphenyl species produced from C6H5I decomposition, or from gas-phase biphenyl dosing, are chemisorbed reversibly and molecularly, with the molecular plane parallel to the surface. These strongly chemisorbed species do not desorb until 400 K. Iodine desorption at 720 K leaves a clean Au(111) surface following TPD of C6H5I adlayers. Carbon–iodine (C–I) bond dissociation to produce phenyl groups (C6H5) occurs at a higher temperature than that required for phenyl–phenyl coupling reactions. Thus, we do not detect the formation of adsorbed, isolated phenyl groups from iodobenzene thermal dissociation on the Au(111) surface."
