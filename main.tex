There is a mounting evidence from experimental and modeling studies that metal atoms can be raised above or completely extracted from a metal surface during the Ullmann reaction. 
This manuscript reviews the results of experimental and computational studies of the surface Ullmann coupling that shed light on the role of surface adatoms in its mechanism. A particular focus is on the early stages of the polymerization and coupling of two monomers.

\section{Introduction}

%RZK0423: The detailed review of the classical Ullmann reaction is saved in the branch named Review-Intro. Dima's comments from January 2021 have not been fully incorporated into the saved version.

\subsection{On-surface Ullmann coupling}

RZK0423: This is Dima's comment: ``You should start with a more extended discussion of the goal of on-surface Ullmann. Discuss GNRs and 2D polymers, give some key figures - to tell the reader why they should care to read the rest of the paper.'' I think figures will be useful in the thesis but not in the article. I have outlined a plan for the first introductory sentences:

* Unique ZZZ properties of one- and two-dimensional materials such as GNRs and 2D polymers make them promising candidates to produce a variety of electronic devices such as ZZZ.

* Main challenges: (a) tuning properties of these materials to the desired range by modifying their atomic composition and structure, (b) cost-effective synthesis of large quantities of these materials free of defects [or with the desired amount of defects], (c) ask Dima.

{\lock

The on-surface Ullmann reaction is currently viewed as a promising bottom-up strategy to assemble, in mild conditions, one- and two-dimensional organic polymers with high degree of control over their electronic properties~\cite{ullmann_33}. 
%
%A recent surge of interest in electronic devices based on low-dimensional organic nanostructures with $\pi$-conjugated backbones has led to a renewed attention to the Ullmann process.
%The recent surge of interest in bottom-up fabrication of functional nanostructures on surfaces....
%
The on-surface Ullmann reaction has been developed from its classical version -- a family of nucleophilic substitution reactions between aromatic halides that proceed in solution in the presence of metallic copper and lead to the formation of a carbon-carbon bond. 
Since its discovery in 1901~\cite{ullmann_01}, the classical Ullmann coupling has rapidly become one of the key reactions in organic synthesis with its scope extended to multiple reactants and Cu-containing catalysts~\cite{ullmann_29,ullmann_30,ullmann_31,ullmann_32}.
%RZK0423: Any other reviews to add to the citation list above? 
The well-established ability of the Ullmann reaction to create bonds between aromatic carbon atoms and couple their $\pi$ systems have been repurposed/adapted to perform synthesis on metal surfaces, which serve as both a low-dimensional confining template and catalyst.
In the context of surface reactions, the term Ullmann coupling has been extended to refer to the reaction on (a) a variety of metals, most often copper, silver and gold OR (b) metals in the copper group: copper, silver and gold (ask Dima).

%RZK0423: Dima's comment about the following sentence: "there was a series of Bent's papers on Ullmann. cite others, too." If necessary change to "by Brent~\textit{et al.}~\cite{sur_sci01, others}." Do not include the year.
One of the first fundamental studies of the surface-confined coupling of iodobenzene to biphenyl under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) condition was reported by Xi and Bent~\cite{sur_sci01} in 1992.
%
The intermediate species of the same reaction were inspected using STM imaging by Weiss \textit{et al.}~\cite{langm01} in 1998. 
In 2004, it was demonstrated that linear \emph{protopolymers}---aligned monomer units that have not yet reacted to form the final polymer---could be obtained by depositing \textit{para}-diiodobenzene on Cu(111) at 77 K~\cite{jacs01}. 
%
This insight showed that the Ullmann coupling can be used not only to synthesize organic molecules but periodic polymers as well. 
The protopolymers have later been identified by Lipton-Duffin \textit{et al.} as periodic organometallic intermediates linked \textit{via} carbon-metal-carbon bonds~\cite{lipton2009synthesis}.
%RZK0423: Cite lipton2009synthesis: Lipton-Duffin, J. A.; Ivasenko, O.; Perepichka, D. F.; Rosei, F., Synthesis of Polyphenylene Molecular Wires by Surface-Confined Polymerization. Small 2009, 5, 592−597.
Remarkably, the Ullmann reaction has been employed for the first synthesis of covalently-bonded nanostructures from molecular building blocks on metal surfaces.
In 2007, Grill \textit{et al.} have prepared patches of a two-dimensional polymer from \textit{tetrakis}(bromophenyl)porphyrin on the Au(111) surface.
%the coupling between brominated tetraphenyl-porphyrins on the Au(111) surface was performed by Grill \textit{et al.}~\cite{Naturenano2007} in 2007.
%
Since then, surface Ullmann coupling has become one of the most representative on-surface synthesis schemes. It has been utilized to create covalently-linked extended aromatic systems on a variety of metal surfaces starting from halogenated aryl precursors~\cite{ullmann_33,ullmann_34, ullmann_42, ullmann_43, ullmann_45, ullmann_46, ullmann_47, ullmann_48}.

\subsection{Mechanism of on-surface Ullmann coupling}

{\lock

[The mechanism of classical Ullmann coupling is relatively well understood (Fig.~\ref{fig:classical}). ]
%The Ullmann coupling reactions discussed above occur mostly in organic solvents. 

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth]{Fig/ullmann_mechanism.png}
\caption{Mechanism of the Ullmann coupling reaction. SET stands for single-electron transfer.
}
\label{fig:classical}
\end{figure}

Although multiple covalently-bonded nanostructures have been obtained on metal surfaces via Ullmann coupling, our knowledge of the mechanism of the surface processes still remains incomplete/fragmentary. 
A thorough understanding of the mechanism of surface Ullmann coupling reaction is essential for tuning reaction conditions and for rational, more precise design of monomers that produce polymers perfectly matching a chosen metal surface.

The focus of the following review of the Ullmann coupling mechanism is entirely on the formation of a carbon-carbon bond from halogen-containing precursors on Cu, Ag and Au surfaces. A particular attention is paid to the monohalogenated benzenes. 

The overall coupling process can be divided into elementary steps depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig_mecha} and described in details below. It should be noted that the surface Ullmann coupling proceeds through the formation of the organometallic intermediates similar to those encountered in the reaction in solution (Fig.~\ref{fig:classical}).

It is widely accepted that an aryl halides molecule reacts with Cu species to form an organometallic intermediate. This intermediate then reacts with a second aryl molecule through oxidative addition producing a diaryl organomitallic intermediate, which subsequently undergoes reductive elimination to form a covalent bond between the two aryls.

\subsubsection{Dehalogenation}

RZK0108: This subsection needs more work following the guidelines discussed in December. Trends in experimental data should be presented first, desirably for Ph-X. Your review will be particularly strong if the trends are discussed across all three metals and three halogens for Ph-X. After experiments, discuss if the trends can be reproduced from simple bond-strength models. Then, present a short summary of DFT calculations to say if the experimental trends can be reproduced using electronic structure methods. I only rearranged your text a bit, you must work on it extensively.

%ZZ0223 delete: The following data illuminates the strong influence of surfaces and halogens on the first step of the Ullmann coupling of two Ph-X. For instance, the dissociaton of iodobenzene occurs at \SI{175}{\kelvin} on Cu(111)~\cite{sur_sci01}, \SI{200}{\kelvin} on Ag(111)~\cite{sur_sci02} and \SIrange{200}{250}{\kelvin} on Au (111)~\cite{sur_sci03}.
%The same trend has been observed for bromobenzene with a higher temperature on all surfaces. RZK0122: Find temperatures for bromo and chloro-benzene.
%ZZ: no experiment data to exact bromo- and chlorobenzne)

\textcolor{blue}{
The type of halogens and surfaces have been illuminated of strong influence on this first step of the Ullmann coupling of two Ph--X. In experiment, the break of most Ph--X bonds will occur at different temperature based on the halogens and the metal substrates. For instance, the dissociation of iodobenzene will be fulfilled at \SI{175}{\kelvin} on Cu(111)~\cite{sur_sci01}, \SI{200}{\kelvin} on Ag(111)~\cite{sur_sci02} and \SIrange{200}{250}{\kelvin} on Au (111)~\cite{sur_sci03}. 
Theoretical work also proves the same trend of iodobenzene on these three surfaces, additionally bromobenzene also shows the similar tendency. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dehalo}~\cite{jacs2013}, the activation barrier and reaction enthalpy of these two precursors both decrease in the order Au $>$ Ag $>$ Cu based on DFT calculations. This data is consistent with the reaction condition of iodobenzene highest on Au(111) and lowest on Cu(111). Br\o nsted-Evans-Polanyi relation states that the activation energy and the reaction enthalpy are linearly dependent. The activation energy for this exothermic dehalogenation of bromobenzene and iodobenzene on (111) metal surfaces are calculated to be \SIrange{0.4}{1.0}{\electronvolt}. And the barrier of iodobenzene keeps around \SI{0.3}{\electronvolt} lower than bromobenzene for all surfaces. This decline can be explained by the dissociation energy of a C--I bond being $\sim$\SI{0.65}{\electronvolt} lower than that of a C--Br bond~\cite{Arpc1982}. The reaction enthalpy of deiodination is also lower than debromination by \SIrange{0.1}{0.4}{\electronvolt}.}
%RZK0123: Any data on chlorobenzene? (ZZ: I did not find for chlorobenzene)


RZK0122: The following paragraph is taken from your mechanism summary. It should be discussed here instead. 

%ZZ0223 delete: The dehalogination of other organic precursors follow the same trends observed for Ph-X. it has been observed that the reactivity trend decrease in the order Ar--I $>$ Ar--Br $>$ Ar--Cl both in experiment and theoretically~\cite{ullmann_52}. This also means that the dissociation of Ar--I bond on metal surface requires the lowest temperature. In addition, the energy barrier of dehalogenation is the highest on Au(111) surface, the lowest on Cu(111) surface both in experiment and in theoretical calculations~\cite{jacs2013}. It has also reported that the miller index of metal surface will also influence the reaction energy of dehalogenation~\cite{ullmann_57}. 

{\color{blue}
Dehalogenation of a variety of other precursors have also been reported, not only limited to Ph--X. For 1,4-dihalobenzene molecules on Cu(110) surface, XPS spectra revealed that dechlorination of dichlorobenzene will be completed at temperature above \SI{400}{\kelvin}~\cite{ullmann_52}, while the cleavage of C--Br, C--I bonds of dibromobenzene, diiodobenzene on Cu(110) will finish under room temperature and deiodination is estimated to require a lower temperature than debromination. Similar trend as Ph--X on difference surface also show for other presursors. The onset temperature for debromination of 1,3,5-tris(4-bromophenyl)benzene on Ag(111) is \SI{75}{\kelvin} lower than on Au(111), and on Au(111) surface the temperature need to be above \SI{325}{\kelvin}. In addition, the molecule hexaiodo-substituted macrocycle cyclohexa-m-phenylene is demonstrated to complete dehalogenation on Cu(111), Ag(111) and Au(111) surface all at room temperature~\cite{ullmann_65}, which indicates that the size of molecule and the quantity of halogens on molecule also possess effect on the dehalogenation conditions.

Dehalogenation on surface are influenced by various factors, such as halogen types and quantities, precursor size as well as the surfaces. The role of halogens and surfaces are well-documented up till now. It can be summarized as the trend of dehalogenation energy follows the order Ar--Cl $>$ Ar--Br $>$ Ar--I for halogen types and Au $>$ Ag $>$ Cu for surfaces.

%ZZ0223 delete: To explain the observed differences in reactivity, the following trends in the bond strength have been derived from model molecular systems.

%
%ZZ0223 delete: The bond dissociation energy of diatomic and CX$_4$ molecules have been used in the cases of the metal-halogen bonds~\cite{ullmann_62} and carbon-halogen bonds~\cite{ullmann_63}, respectively. The relative strength of metal-carbon bond strength has been estimated using the metal-carbon bond distances in M-(CH$_3$)$_2$ molecules~\cite{ullmann_61}.

%ZZ0223 delete: By combining the strength of all metal-halogen bonds shown above the following series emerges

%\end{gather*}
%

RZK0108: Why you are ordering the strength of metal-halogen bonds? Is it uselful for predicting of the kinetics of the first step (i.e. reaction temperature)? I do not expect this trend to be suitable for the thermodynamics that is certainly affected not only by M-X strength but also by C-X and C-M strengths. We need to predict the energy of this step: C-X bond is broken, C-M bond is formed, X-M bond is formed. Has it been done in any review articles?

%ZZ0223 delete: DFT calculations have estimated the activation barrier for the exothermic dehalogenation of bromobenzene and iodobenzene on (111) metal surfaces to be \SIrange{0.4}{1.0}{\electronvolt}~\cite{jacs2013}. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dehalo}, the activation barrier and reaction energy decrease in the order Au $>$ Ag $>$ Cu and are \SIrange{0.1}{0.5}{\electronvolt} lower for iodobenzene than bromobenzene. The latter is due to the dissociation energy of a C--I bond being $\sim$\SI{0.65}{\electronvolt} lower than that of a C--Br bond~\cite{Arpc1982}. RZK0123: Any data on chlorobenzene?

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Diffusion}

{\lock

The dehalogenation step produces organometallic intermediates with carbon atoms covalently bonded directly to metal atoms. 
The diffusion of these species, which has been observed experimentally and studied computationally, plays a decisive role in the further coupling process. 
A high mobility of molecules increases the chances of two molecules moving closer to each and forming a bond. Therefore, low energy barriers for diffusion process are a prerequisite for the self-assembly of well-ordered networks

Among dehalogenated precursors, the diffusion of a phenyl group has been studied most thoroughly. 
Computational studies have considered sliding or flipping mechanisms of diffusion. 
In the sliding diffusion, a phenyl group keeps its orientation to the surface in the initial, transition and final states. The energy barrier of the sliding diffusion on (111)metal surfaces decreases from \SI{0.44}{\electronvolt} on Cu to \SI{0.29}{\electronvolt} on Ag and to \SI{0.22}{\electronvolt} on Au\cite{jacs2013}. 
In the flipping diffusion, a phenyl group increases its tilting angle, achieves the upright configuration and then overturns to bind to an adjacent metal atom. 
For this diffusion mechanism, the change in the magnitude of the diffusion barriers follows a different trend and decreases from \SI{0.19}{\electronvolt} on Au to \SI{0.07}{\electronvolt} on Cu and to \SI{0.06}{\electronvolt} on Ag~\cite{pccp2010, jacs2013}. 
The low calculated barriers agree with STM studies that have revealed that dehalogenated phenyl groups diffuse on the Cu (111) surface at temperatures as low as \SI{77}{\kelvin}~\cite{langm01}.

It should be noted that the flipping diffusion may not contribute significantly for larger precursor molecules, especially those anchored to the surface by several covalent bonds. The stronger surface-molecule interaction will favor diffusion mechanism with the molecular plane remaining parallel to the surface. 
{\color{blue}
For example, dehalogenated cyclohexa-m-phenylene diffuse on copper and silver surface will remain in sliding pattern due to its large steric size. In addition, the diffusion is also affected by the kind of substrate. DFT calculation shows a higher energy barrier of this molecule diffusing on Cu(111) than Ag(111) by \SI{1.4}{\electronvolt}~\cite{ullmann_65}, this is due to the stronger interaction between this molecule and copper atom compared to silver atom.
}
%RZZK: This is from jacs2013
%Furthermore, the presence of Cu adatoms may impact the self-assembly more than the poor diffusion on the atomically flat Cu(111) surface. These adatoms are known to have a great influence on selfassembly on Cu(111), where in many cases coordination bonds are formed instead of covalent networks.21 The Cu adatoms can also contribute to the covalent bonding of the nanostructure.22,23 (%ZZ maybe we should add this in the diffusion section in adatom part)

Halogen atoms chemisorbed on the surface can also undergo the diffusion process. The binding energy of halogens and their diffusion barriers have been investigated using DFT calculations~\cite{jacs2013}, which show that halogens hop between fcc and hcp hollow sites with the transition state being the bridge site. The diffusion barriers for a variety of metal-halogen combinations have been found to be in the \SIrange{0.05}{0.10}{\eV} range, implying that the halogens are highly mobile on the three metal surfaces at coupling experimental temperatures. The barrier tends to be largest on Au(111) and smallest on Cu(111). At high surface coverage, halogens atoms bonded to the surface can hinder the diffusion of organic precursors preventing them from approaching each other and hence slowing down the coupling process. 

The energy barrier of chlorine, bromine and iodine diffusing on Cu(111), Ag(111) and Au(111) are listed in Table~\ref{table:1}.

%RZK0122: Should we add the following citation to the previous paragaph?
%There are few experiment works related to the diffusion of halogen atoms on metal surface, but it is much better investigated theoretically using DFT calculations~\cite{ullmann_66}.

%RZK0122: The following data can be added but only as a table, not text.
%Atomic bromine has been reported to have a diffusion energy barrier of \SI{0.09}{\electronvolt}, \SI{0.07}{\electronvolt} and \SI{0.06}{\electronvolt} on Au(111), Ag(111) and Cu(111) respectively. Atomic iodine have a barrier of \SI{0.11}{\electronvolt}, \SI{0.06}{\electronvolt} and \SI{0.06}{\electronvolt} on Au(111), Ag(111) and Cu(111) respectively. And atomic chlorine have a barrier of \SI{0.02}{\electronvolt} and \SI{0.08}{\electronvolt} on Au(111) and Cu(111) respectively.

Similar bridge intermediate will be constructed by depositing dibromoterphenyl on Cu(111) and Ag(111) surfaces at room temperature, characterized and confirmed by the same method~\cite{jacs2011, PCCP2012}.}

The rate-determining step of forming a bridge intermediates is illuminated to be dehalogenation~\cite{ullmann_91}. C--M--C intermediates are formed when depositing 1,3-bis(p-bromophenyl)-5-(p-iodophenyl)benzene on Ag(111) surface at room temperature along with the proceeding of dehalogenation. However, debromination of the precursors will be completed at \SI{300}{\kelvin}, and then STM image captures that most precursors are transformed to bridge intermediates at this temperature.

, a covalent C--C bond is formed spontaneously and irreversibly between the two organic precursors anchored to the same metal atom. The structural changes in this elementary step as well as its energetics have been extensively studied using experiments and simulations.

} %lock
{\color{blue}
The process of forming C--C bond between two phenyl groups are widely and earliest explored on multiple surfaces. It has been reported the temperature for complete conversion to biphenyl on Cu(111) is at \SI{350}{\kelvin}~\cite{ullmann_68}, 
on Ag(111) at \SIrange{300}{370}{\kelvin}~\cite{sur_sci02}, on Au(111) at \SIrange{200}{250}{\kelvin}~\cite{sur_sci03} in temperature programmed desorption experiments. 
%RZK0122: The same experimental data for Ag and Au is necessary. This is the data mentioned in pccp2010 (references must be renumbered). The biphenyl formation temperatures are higher on Cu(111) (over 300 K) [5,6], and lower on Au(111) (165--180 K) [9] and on Ag(111) (110 K) [4].
In agreement with experiments, DFT calculations indicate that the formation the C--C bond for two phenyl groups is highly exothermic and for all surfaces~\cite{jacs2013}. They also demonstrate (Fig.~\ref{fig:coupling}) that the potential energy change of this step is highest on Ag(111) with \SI{-2.72}{\electronvolt}, on Au(111) is \SI{-2.66}{\electronvolt} and lowest on Cu(111) with \SI{-2.07}{\electronvolt}. Whereas the energy barrier is also highest on Ag(111) with \SI{0.30}{\electronvolt}, but lowest on Au(111) with \SI{0.00}{\electronvolt} and \SI{0.14}{\electronvolt} on Cu. The activation energy for back-forward reaction is so high that the formation of C--C bond is considered irreversible.

{\color{blue}
The investigation of this step has also been extended to a large scope of precursor choices, the monomer displays a equally decisive effect on the reaction condition of Ullmann coupling compared to the dehalogenation. STM technique offers a efficient approach to obtain the temperature information step. 
For example, 4-bromobiphenyl was proven to dimerize on Ag(111) surface at \SI{400}{\kelvin}, on Cu(111) at \SI{460}{\kelvin} and on Cu(110) at \SI{470}{\kelvin}~\cite{ullmann_92}.
1,3,6,8-Tetrabromopyrene has been reported to form C--C bond at \SI{473}{\kelvin} on Cu(111), at \SI{573}{\kelvin} on Au(111)~\cite{ullmann_93}.
While for molecule Cl--(ph)$_3$--Cl, it was found that this new bond is constructed at \SI{430}{\kelvin} on Cu(111), at \SI{470}{\kelvin} on Ag(111) and \SI{570}{\kelvin} on Au(111)~\cite{ullmann_93}.  
Summarizing the reaction condition of various monomers other than halobenzene  dimerizing on copper, silver and gold surface, we can conclude that the energy barrier for formation of C--C bond should decrease by the order Au $>$ Cu $>$ Ag.

If the monomers contain more than one functional group, the Ulmann coupling proceeds further with the formation of trimers~\cite{jacs2016}, oligomers~\cite{ullmann_53, ullmann_56} or polymers~\cite{ullmann_43, ullmann_54, ullmann_55}. DFT modeling of the dimerization and trimerization of 1,4-dibromobenzene on Cu(100) surface shows that the activation energy for the C--C bond formation is \SI{0.89}{\electronvolt} and \SI{0.55}{\electronvolt}, respectively~\cite{jacs2016}. The consequent C--C formation leads to covalently bonded conjugated structure, which has also been validated with STM and fast-XPS in experiment. At \SI{470}{\kelvin}, alternating lines of poly(para-phenylene) will be comstructed from 1,4-dibromobenzene will through Ullmann coupling on Cu(110)~\cite{acsnano2013}. A growing number of multihalogen precursors are reported capable of forming 1D or 2D covalently conjugated structure on surface by further increasing the temperature after the C--C formation, such as polythiophene from 2,5-diiodo-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene on Cu(110) at above \SI{470}{\kelvin}~\cite{ullmann_95}, more details have been discussed in our previous paper~\cite{ullmann_44}.

%ZZ0223 deleted: The general trend [RZK0122: is it really true for all metals?] is that the final C--C bond formation step requires the highest temperature among all other steps of the coupling process~\cite{Naturenano2007, ullmann_70, ullmann_71}. For example, for dichlorobenzene, dibromobenzene and diiodobenzene on Cu(110), the formation of C--C bond requires a temperature ranging from \SIrange{410}{450}{\kelvin}, which is noticeably higher than the \SIrange{170}{370}{\kelvin} temperature needed for the dehalogenation~\cite{ullmann_44}. 
RZK0122: The following sentence is inconsistent with the previous section.
On other type of Cu surface, as well on Ag and on Au surface, a higher annealing temperature for C--C coupling has also been
reported than dehalogenation steps~\cite{Naturenano2007, ullmann_70, ullmann_71}.

{\color{blue}

RZK0122: The following sentence is also inconsistent with the previous section. It should be explained and placed in the next section, where all steps analyzed together.  
Comparative analysis of different metal surfaces shows that the C--C bond formation requires \SIrange{330}{420}{\kelvin} temperature on Ag surface and \SIrange{500}{600}{\kelvin} on Au surface~\cite{ullmann_51}. On Cu, the temperature range is usually lower than on Au but higher than on Ag. This indicates that the energy barrier of the formation of C--C bond step on the three metal surfaces should follow Au $>$ Cu $>$ Ag. }

%RZK0122: The idea and references are taken from jacs2016. Check Cu(111) trend.
The onset temperatures of the dehalogenation and C--C bond formation steps are ultimately determined by the surface reactivity. Since carbon-metal steps are formed during the first step and broken during the second step the energy barriers for these two steps are often anticorrelated~\cite{jacs2016}. On surfaces such as Au(111) where the dehalogenation barrier is high the barrier for ejecting the metal atom from the organometallic bridge structure is often so low that the bridge state is rarely detected. In contrast, on surfaces such as Cu(110) and Cu(111) where the dehalogenation barrier is low, high temperature is required to convert the intermediate states into dimers, oligomers or polymers.
%ZZ: I think I need a discussion on this section.
}

RZK0122: Do not reiterate what you said for each step. Any other correlations between observed trends to describe? Describe any general remarks here. For example, what problems that can be resolved by learning the mechanism (e.g. well-ordered polymers for devices)?

RZK1220: What comes next is not relevant to diffusion. Should we even discuss it in the summary of the mechanism? Should we perhaps create a separate subsection "Desorption"?

Besides, as we mentioned in the diffusion section that the energy barrier for halogens to diffuse on all metal surfaces are very low, which means halogens may have a high mobility after dissociation. Although halogens are free to move, they possess a relatively high binding energy to metals. The lowest binding energy is halogens on Au(111), around \SI{2.8}{\electronvolt} and the highest is on Cu(111), around \SI{3.1}{\electronvolt}, which indicates that the halogens are even harder to desorb than those dehalogenated phenyl groups. Research also showed that the halogens remained on metal surface will further hinder the diffusion, coupling and polymerization of all kinds of phenyl species~\cite{ullmann_64,ullmann_65}. Removing the byproducts of on-surface Ullmann coupling is also of great significance.


\subsection{Role of adatoms in the surface Ullmann coupling} 

{\lock

Metal surfaces are not perfect well-ordered structures. There exists various defects on metal surfaces ranging from three-dimensional defect such as pores~\cite{ullmann_72} and cracks~\cite{ullmann_73} to planar defects such as twin boundaries~\cite{ullmann_74} and stacking faults~\cite{ullmann_75}, line defects such as dislocations~\cite{Ullmann_76} and to point defects such as adatoms~\cite{Ullmann_77} and vacancies~\cite{ullmann_78}.
\sout{A variety of surface defects are shown schematically in Fig.}~\ref{cyrstal_surface}~\cite{ullmann_49}.
{\color{blue}
It is known that all kinds of crystal surface are not free of these defects shown schematically in Fig.~\ref{cyrstal_surface}~\cite{ullmann_49}.
}

In the process of Ullmann coupling, reactants, intermediates and final products interact directly with metal atoms on the surface and, therefore, can be affected by surface defects. Quantifying the extent to which imperfections of the metal surface influence the thermodynamics and kinetics of the Ullmann coupling can suggest new strategies for surface optimization, leading, in turn, to higher yields of desirable two-dimensional polymers.

Surface metal atoms that affect and participate in the Ullmann coupling have different \emph{nature} and \emph{origins}.
Atom's nature describes its immediate environment. Atoms located in the first layer of atoms of the ideal surface will be referred to as \emph{ideal-surface} atoms. \emph{Adatoms}, according to the commonly accepted definition, lie on top of the layer of ideal-surface atoms. In this work, adatoms are differentiated according to their origin and can be \emph{pre-existing} and \emph{extracted} adatoms. The origin of pre-existing atoms is irrelevant, not specified, or not known. Extracted adatoms, on the other hand, are known to have been lifted from their lattice sites and placed on top of the surface leaving a surface vacancy behind~\cite{ullmann_96}. In this work, \emph{vacancy} refers exclusively to vacant lattice positions on the surface, not in the bulk.
%RZZK: This section might be better placed into Definitions/Notation part of the manuscript.
%RZZK: The talk about nature and origins is perhaps too formalized. I will simplify it later later.

%%%Here the two terminology $Nature$ and $Origin$ will be used to distinguish the metal atoms which participate in suface Ullmann coupling.
%%%The $Nature$ of metal atoms means metal atoms can come from (1) surface atom which is located at the first layer on metal surface, is indistinguishable from other surface atoms and has no relation with surface defect, or (2) adatoms which is related to the surface defect, it will lie above the first layer of metal surface and free to diffuse.
%%%Thus, the $nature$ mainly divide the metal atoms from a surface into two categories, the first kind is indistinguishable and locate in the lattice of metal crystal, while the second kind is adatoms, which is a production of common non-order defect appeared on metal surface. 
%%%The process that gives birth to $nature(2)$, adatoms in surface Ullmann coupling reaction is also of great interest. It can be split into two different kinds with notation $origin$: adatoms in surface Ullmann coupling may come from (1) pre-exsiting adatoms before the occurrence of surface Ullmann coupling due to the surface defect, thermal punctuation or (2)pulled out by the intermediates produced in surface Ullmann coupling, and then fully sit above the first layer of metal surface to become a new adatom. For the second origin of adatoms, it can also be expressed that the surface Ullmann coupling create this adatom which used to be a $nature(1)$ atom. 

} %lock


{\color{blue}

The nature of metal atoms and the origin of adatoms have been explored experimentally and computationally.
%For origin(1), it has been reported that the onset of the vacancy-adatom formation take place on Cu(111) surface was around 900 K by molecular dynamics~\cite{ullmann_50} , which is much higher than the temperature required by surface Ullmann coupling reaction, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:2Dgasn}~\cite{ullmann_50}. This could be the evidence that there would not be new adatoms formation due to the thermal fluctuations as the surface Ullmann coupling proceeds. 

%discuss that adatoms could exit on metal surface due to the thermal evaporation
For pre-existing adatoms, it has been explored that Cu adatoms can be released on Cu(111) surface by thermal activation~\cite{ullmann_79, ullmann_58}, silver and gold adatoms can be released on silver and gold surface respectively as well~\cite{ullmann_84, ullmann_85}, especially near surface defects. These adatoms have also been previously observed to
participate in metal organic coordination networks~\cite{ullmann_80, ullmann_81, ullmann_82, ullmann_83}. This coordination phenomena provides a feasible 
possibility that the formation of carbon--metal intermediates in surface Ullmann coupling can directly make use of pre-existing adatoms.
Thus, it can be naturally derived that there is a competition between ideal-surface atoms and adatoms which actually take part in the structure of intermediates in Ullmann coupling. Also if it is ideal-surface atoms that comprise intermediates, these ideal-surface atoms can also be fully extracted out from the first layer and become extracted adatoms, which can be regarded as an approach to create adatoms on metal surface.
The details of the these arguments are discussed in following sections.


%ZZ: Dima asked to find the concentration of adatoms at RT, i did not find it with a long time, will finish it later.

\end{figure}

{\color{blue}

Multitude of evidences have been presented that metal atoms will participate in dehalogenation as discussed in above section. However, it is still unclear whether ideal-surface atoms or adatoms are involved in this process. DFT calculations demonstrated that dehalogenation, as the first step of Ullmann coupling, has possibility to originate a new adatom by fully extracting an ideal-surface atom out from the first layer~\cite{chemeurope2017}. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:3}, formation of an adatom on ideal, perfect Cu(111), Ag(111) and Au(111) surface require \SI{1.71}{\electronvolt}, \SI{1.12}{\electronvolt} and \SI{1.15}{\electronvolt} respectively. Dehalogenation of iodobenzene will result in phenyl-metal species, the energies of this interaction with full extraction of ideal-surface atom were calculated to be \SI{0.64}{\electronvolt}, \SI{0.40}{\electronvolt} and \SI{0.16}{\electronvolt} for Cu, Ag and Au surfaces, decreased by \SI{1.07}{\electronvolt}, \SI{0.72}{\electronvolt} and \SI{0.99}{\electronvolt}, respectively. The significant reduction in energy indicates that a new adatom can probably be created from an ideal-surface atom by organometallic intermediates produced in dehalogenation. 

\sout{But it has also been reported that the interaction between single phenyl groups and copper atoms are not adequate enough to fully extract an ideal-surface atom out. These phenyl groups produced after dehalogenation will start to diffuse on Cu(111) surface and interact with different ideal-surface atoms to form organometallic intermediates~\cite{pccp2010} while all ideal-surface atoms involved will stay on their original locations after diffusion.}
%Dima: the line out part is irrelevant to the dehalogenation part.

Till now it can be concluded that dehalogenation lowers the energy required for creation of adatoms from ideal-surface atoms on a metal surface. 
The direct use of pre-existing adatoms should ideally cut down the energy barrier for this step compared to ideal-surface atoms.
%Dima: This makes no sense. The energy of a step X is not affected by existence of an alternative step Y. (ZZ: a pre-existing adatom will affect the initial geometry of dehalogenation.)
However, few work has been related to pre-existing adatoms in dehalogenation.

}

%Evidences have already been presented that metal adatoms participate in the process of dehalogenation. 
%In 2017, Barton \textit{et al.}~\cite{chemeurope2017} explored the role of adatoms in the dehalogenation step with iodobenzene on Au(111), Ag(111) and Cu(111) surface based on DFT calculations. The energy profile of adatom formation on pristine surface was compared with the profile of formation on surface with the presence of iodobenzene, the latter case is referred to as adatom formation of $origin(2)$. The comparison has shown that the energy of extracting a metal atom from the pristine surface was in the 1.12 - 1.71~eV range. While in the dehalogenation step, the dehalogenated iodobenzene would interact with the metal atom of $nature(1)$ on metal surface, which would possibly form a new adatom of $origin(2)$. This step required a dramatically lower energy of 0.16-0.60~eV range. Furthermore, the calculations have shown that the energy released in the process of adsorption of idobenzene on metal surface and formation of organometallic intermediates in the process of surface Ullmann coupling is sufficient to compensate the energy required for a metal atom extraction to form a new adatom of $origin(2)$, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:3}.
%
%It is clear that metal atoms of $nature(1)$ have a great chance to participate in dehalogenation, the first step of surface Ullmann coupling. And the construction of organometallic intermediate in the dehalogenation could possibly be a feasible pathway to form adatom of $origin(2)$. Metal atoms of $nature(2)$ in the dehalogenation had few related reports to date.

%The diffusion process is involved in the interaction between single precursor group and metal atom. 
%In 2018, Nagoya \textit{et al.}~\cite{jpcc2018} investigated the mechanism of Ullmann coupling of 7,10-dibromofluoranthene (Br$_{2}$FL) on Au(111) via DFT calculations. Compared to simple phenyl rings that tend to form ~$36^\circ$ tilt angle with Cu(111) surface~\cite{pccp2010}, the monobromo FL with one Br atom removed would stay almost parallel to Au(111) surface due to steric repulsion between the large backbone of BrFL group and the substrate. And BrFL group was found to lift surface Au atom out by 1.9 \angstrom\ from its initial position, which is much larger than 0.16 \angstrom\ height lifted by a simpole phenyl ring, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:diff}.
%Ebeling \textit{et al.}~\cite{acsnano2019} also indicated 4-bromo-3$^{''}$-iodo-$p$-terphenyl group interacts with the Cu atom inside the surface, and would partially lift the Cu atom out from the surface while diffusing on Cu(111) surface. 
%
%Metal atoms of $nature(1)$ were proven to play a significant role in the diffusion of dehalogenated phenyl groups, the metal atoms that interact with phenly groups will be partially lifted from its original position, the lifting height is affected by the intensity of interaction between the phenyl group and metal atom. Formation of adatom of $origin(2)$ has not been reported in diffusion, which indicates that the interaction between phenyl group and metal atom in this step is not in the magnitude to fully extract a metal atom of $nature(1)$. 

{\color{blue}

There were no apparent proof that placing dehalogenated species on metal surface can form new adatoms from ideal-surface atoms. Most reports assumed that dehalogenated intermediates interact with ideal-surface atoms in diffusion process. The energy involved in this type of interaction is determined by the geometry of intermediates and type of metal atoms.

For single phenyl groups diffusing on Cu(111), ideal-surface copper atom is lifted only by \SI{0.16}{\angstrom} from its original position in diffusion~\cite{pccp2010}, the height is insufficient to create an adatom on surface by full extraction. With the molecular size increasing, the steric repulsion of precursor radical and surface can change the pattern of diffusing, the metal atom will be lifted higher and the precursor will stay more parallel to the surface. For example, DFT calculations revealed that bromofluoranthene radical (dehalogenated one bromide from dibromofluoranthene) will lift an ideal-surface gold atom up to \SI{0.5}{\angstrom} after dehalogenation~\cite{jpcc2018}. Then in the diffusion of this aryl radical on Au(111) surface, it will interact and adsorb different ideal-surface gold atom along the mobile path, the largest height each gold atom raised is up to \SI{1.9}{\angstrom} and the molecule remains almost parallel to Au(111) surface. Two bromofluoranthene radical diffusing to each other will adsorb a common gold atom and fully exact it out of first layer by \SI{2.2}{\angstrom} and leave a vacancy below, which suggests that the interaction between two these aryl radicals and gold atom is more intensive and enough to create an adatom compared to single aryl radical.

The evidence of pre-existing adatoms are involved in this step is not reported. It can be speculated that diffusion of aryl groups on metal surface can seldom create adatoms since the intensity of interaction between one dehalogenated species and metal atoms is not sufficient to fully extract ideal-surface atoms out.

\subsubsection{Formation of C--M--C structure intermediates} \label{sec:dimerized-adatom}

%The nature of the metal atoms in dimerized organometallic intermediate has been investigated through multiple approaches. Besides, it can be deduced that an metal atom of $nature(2)$, which is also an adatom of $origin(1)$ will exit above the first layer of surface before the surface Ullmann coupling reacion occurs. And this atom can attract two phenyl groups diffuse close to it and form the dimerized organometallic intermediate in this step. This type of formation might require less energy compared to the situation that two phenyl groups both interact with the same metal atom of $nature(1)$. The arguments on the nature and origin of metal atoms in this step are intense in the mechanism of surface Ullmann coupling.

%In 2017, Zint \textit{et al.}~\cite{acsnano2017} analyzed structures of intermediates in the polymerization of bromotriphenylene to bistriphenylene on Cu(111) surface using STM, AFM image and DFT calculations. Two computational models were compared: two triphenylene molecules bonded to an fully-out-of-surface adatom (a metal atom of $nature(2)$) and two precursors bonded to an atom partially lifted from Cu surface (a metal atom of $nature(1)$) as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:5}. It has been concluded that the structures observed in AFM were more consistent with computational adatom ($nature(2)$) models. In particular, the C--C distance in organometallic intermediate was of 3.9 \angstrom\ measured by AFM, which was closer to the Cu adatom ($nature(2)$) model (3.86 \angstrom) compared to the partially-lifted Cu atom ($nature(1)$) model (3.42 \angstrom). Furthermore, the energy for formation of the adatom-containing intermediate from distant precursors was 1.74~eV lower than that of the intermediate with a partially lifted atoms.

\label{fig:5}
\end{figure}

%The origin the adatoms were later explored after the metal atoms in dimerized organometallic intermediates were proven to be of $nature(2)$, which is an adatom on surface. In 2019, the study of 4‐Bromo-3$^{''}$- iodo‐$p$‐terphenyl coupling on Cu(111), proved again that the Cu atoms in dimerized organometallic intermediates were adatoms (metal atoms of $nature(2)$) compared experiments with simulated AFM image[Fig.~\ref{fig:6}~\cite{acsnano2019}]. It was further suggested that these adatoms are generated by the extraction of two close single precursor groups (adatom of $origin(2)$), instead of pre-exsiting adatoms (adatoms of $origin(1)$) from a statistic study of all intermediates species in the surface Ullmann coupling.

The STM image of the unlinked dimer reveals a dark region between the two molecules that separates them.

\end{figure}

%The nature of metal atoms in dimerized organometallic intermediates has been proven to be an adatom. And further the origin of this adatom is of $origin(2)$, which indicates before the surface Ullmann coupling reaction occurs, the adatom is still a metal atom of $nature(1)$, stay in the first layer of metal surface. After it was selected from two phenyl groups in coupling procedure, it will be fully lifted out of the surface, become a new adatoms. The effect of metal atom in the last step --- formation of C--C bond was not investigated intensive compared to previous steps.

%%In addition, chlorinated prophyrin as precursor has also been deposited on Cu(111)~\cite{chematerial2019}. Based on DFT calculations, the Cu adatom mediated path is 3~eV lower than the direct dechlorination. And from STM image, some precursors are still intact at temperature of 400~K, which should be already dehalogenated at lower temperature. It proves that the Cu adatoms are the limiting agent [Fig.~\ref{fig:prophyrin}].

{\color{blue}
The mechanism of metal atoms participating in the formation of C--M--C bridges structure are intensively investigated. Multiple approaches have been used to figure out it is adatoms or ideal surface atoms that actually constitute the C--M--C bridge~\cite{acsnano2017}. 

\sout{It has been proven that two phenyl groups, after diffusing to adjacent position, will bind to the same ideal surface copper atom and form C--Cu--C structure on Cu(111)}~\cite{pccp2010, acsnano2019}.
\sout{Similar structure will be constructed on Ag(111) and Au(111) surface from phenyls and ideal surface silver and gold atoms.}

Fig.~\ref{fig:5} describes the C--Cu--C structure formed by two triphenylene moieties with a copper atom on Cu(111) surface using AFM and DFT methods~\cite{acsnano2017}. Two distinct simulation models are shown: (1) the copper atom in C--Cu--C structure comes from ideal surface atom as shown in (c) and (d). This ideal surface atom is partially lifted up from its original position in the first layer of metal; and (2) the copper atom in C--Cu--C is an adatom as pictured in (e) and (f). Two model are compared with AFM image on atomic properties. The distance between carbon and carbon in this C--Cu--C bridge in AFM, ideal surface model and adatom model are \SI{3.90}{\angstrom}, \SI{3.42}{\angstrom} and \SI{3.86}{\angstrom} respectively, which shows that the adatom model is more consistent with the molecule geometry in experiment. This is in agreement with DFT calculations showing that the energy for formation of C--Cu--C bridge structure from these precursors with adatom is estimated to be \SI{1.74}{\electronvolt} lower than with ideal surface atom, both from two chemisorbed dehalogenated radicals on Cu(111) surface as initial states. \sout{The metal atoms in C--M--C intermediate structure were proven to be adatoms with clear evidence for the first time. Then the pathway of emerging such adatoms was also reported.(Dima)} This proves that it is highly likely to be adatom that make up the C--M--C structure.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:6}, the STM and simulated AFM image of forming C--Cu--C intermediate structure from 4‐bromoterphenyl and copper atom are displayed~\cite{acsnano2019}. Based on the comparison of the experimental STM and simulated AFM image data, the metal atom participated in the C--Cu--C structure is again, proven to be adatoms rather than an partially lifted ideal surface atom. Furthermore, these adatoms, according to the statistic data, are created during the surface Ullmann coupling reaction by extracting the ideal surface atoms out instead of pre-existing adatoms before the coupling process.

In this step, the actual state of origin and nature of metal atoms involved still remains unclear. Previously works suggest that for some intermediates, there is compelling evidence to consider adatoms taking part in C--M--C intermediate structures. And the formation of such a bridge structure can serve as a feasible strategy to create adatoms on Cu(111) surface. However, as discussed in former section, the strength of interaction between aryl groups and metal atoms is defined both by the structure of aryl group as well as the type of metal atoms. Whether surface Ullmann coupling on different surfaces will proceed via the same adatom based mechanism still remains an open question.
}

\subsubsection{Formation of the C--C bond}
{\color{blue}
For the last step, in which a C--C bond is constructed in the coupling. The role of metal atom in this formation has also been reported, but rarely compared to other steps discussed above. However, there are numerous unsolved questions in this step, such as the possibility of creating a brand new adatom from ideal surface adatom in this step, the final destiny of metal atom involved in reaction after Ullmann coupling is finished, the influence of adatom on further successive coupling.

The energy profile and geometry evolution of bromofluoranthene coupling to dimer has been investigated with CI-NEB calculations, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:7}. The height of common gold atom adsorbed by two aryl radicals is largest up to \SI{2.2}{\angstrom} in the C--Au--C bridge structure, which can be regarded as an adatom fully extracted and create a vacancy below. Then the height keep lowering with the reduce of distance between two unsaturated carbon atoms. In the end, the gold adatom return back to its original position along with the formation of dimer. It advises that the adatom created in C--M--C structure step will only exist until the completion of Ullmann coupling. It can not be conferred as a real creation of adatom, which can further diffuse on metal surface and be different from other ideal surface atoms.

\section{Methods}
%\subsection{Computation Models}

\subsection{Computational Details}

The periodic density functional theory calculations were performed using the Perdew–Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) for the exchange-correlation functional, the projector augmented wave method for the ion-core electron interactions, and a plane-wave basis set as implemented in the Vienna ab-initio simulation package (VASP) code. Van der Waals (vdW) interactions were included using the DFT-D3 method to describe the nonlocal correlation energy. 

The Cu(111) surface used in all Ullmann coupling was 
modeled by a four-layered slab consisting of 192 Cu atoms and at least \SI{15}{\angstrom} of vacuum. Each layer is made up with 48 ($8\times 6$) Cu atoms. The relaxations were performed with applying spin-polarization. The energy cut-off for the plane-wave basis was set to \SI{800}{\electronvolt} and a $3\times 3 \times1$ k-mesh was adopted. The mesh density of k points was kept fixed in related calculations with primitive cells. All atoms were fully relaxed until the MAX force on the atom was less than $2\times 10^{-2}$ \si{\electronvolt}$/$\si{\angstrom}$^{2}$. 

Transition-state calculations were carried out using a Climbing-Image Nudged Elastic Band (CI-NEB) methods with VTST code\cite{ullmann_59}. An improved initial guess~\cite{ullmann_60, ullmann_99} for minimum energy path was conducted in CI-NEB calculation, different number of intermediates were interpolated between the initial and final configurations due to the distance between them. Plus, All atoms were fully relaxed until the MAX force on the atom was less than \SI{0.1}{\electronvolt}/\si{\angstrom}$^{2}$ in CI-NEB calculations.

Generally the value of most thermodynamic functions can be derived from our DFT optimization results. 
(%ZZ1215: still miss the math part, will add later)

The simulation of surface Ullmann coupling reaction was conducted with chlorobenzene, bromobenzene and iodobenzene on Cu(111) surface. We explored the mechanism discussed above step by step including the least reported step --- formation of C--C bond.

In the dehalogenation step, the CI-NEB method was used in chlorobenzene, bromobenzene and iodobenzene precursors to study how different halogens will affect on the dissociation of carbon-halogen bonds. CI-NEB method offered us energy profile diagram as well the transition state.

Choice for the zero-energy state.

\subsection{Physisorption}

{\lock

Before organic precursors undergo chemical transformations, they are first physisorbed on a metal surface. 
The adsorption energies calculated in this work for a single molecule of chlorobenzene, bromobenzene and iodobenzene on Cu(111) are \SI{-1.06}{\electronvolt}, \SI{-1.18}{\electronvolt} and \SI{-1.37}{\electronvolt}, respectively (Fig.~\ref{fig:completeenergy}). 
The predicted binding is \SI{0.24}{\electronvolt} stronger than that obtained previously using the optB86b exchange-correlation functional: \SI{-0.95}{\electronvolt} for bromobenzene and \SI{-1.12}{\electronvolt} for iodobenzene~\cite{jacs2013}. The difference in the strength of adsorption between iodobenzene and bromobenzene is almost exactly the same ($\sim$\SI{0.18}{\electronvolt}) in this and previous works.

%RZK0415: The strong binding between the surface and halogenated benzenes is primarily due to the interaction of (a) the $\pi$-system (b) halogen and . For example, the energy of interaction between biphenyl and the metal is ZZZ whereas Br$_2$ molecule interacts with the surface by ZZZ.

RZK0422: The following text is not mine and should not be in the red zone. My comment above is only a template, not the final text. Either (a) or (b) should be chosen in the final text. Moreover, 4.08 eV seems to be too strong for a vdW interaction.

The strong binding of halobenzenes on surface is primarily due to the van der Waals interaction of (a) the $\pi$-system and (b) halogens with the metal surface. For example, the energy of interaction between biphenyl and copper is \SI{1.72}{\electronvolt} whereas Br$_2$ molecule interacts with the surface by \SI{4.08}{\electronvolt}.

\subsection{Dehalogenation}

%RZK0312: Put Figures~\ref{fig:dissociation_Cl}, \ref{fig:dissociation_Br} and \ref{fig:dissociation_I} into supplementary information (SI). Keep only the structures (not the energy profile) for bromobenzene in the main text. Learn how to make references to a different document in LaTeX and make references to the figures in the SI.
%Note that these figures are of low quality. Atoms are pixilated -- higher resolution in VMD is necessary. Ball-and-stick is a poor choice to show alongated bonds in transition states. Graphs are poorly formatted (as discussed today). For all figures that remain in the main text much better formatting is necessary. Please look at figures in other articles (for example atoms in figure~\ref{fig:7}
%c) and make ours of the same quality. 

%RZK0317: Too many numbers in the text are difficult to read. Energies and energy barriers for all steps can be easier to compare if they are shown in a table or a figure (discussion is needed). Table might show, for each elementary step, energy of the forward reaction and it energy barrier. This data can also be shown in the figure, if halogens are kept separate.

%RZK0317: Energy profiles for all three halogens (or even five halogen-metal combinations) must be presented in the same plot (details to be discussed).

\caption{Dissociation of the C--Br bond on the Cu(111) surface. Yellow, cyan, white, red, RYK spheres represent copper, carbon, hydrogen, bromine, RYK atoms, respectively. 
%RZK0326: All figures with atoms need further work. The sideways view is not necessary here because it does not provide any useful info. Hydrogen and carbon spheres must be visible. Copper spheres are way too small: your choice of Cu radius makes Cu metal look like a layered material. The resolution of spheres is terrible -- they do not look like sphere but more as polygons. There should be no lines on sphere surfaces. If in doubt about the choice of parameters, see Fig.~\ref{fig:7} as an example of an excellent figure. In addition to this, all your figures and graphs have inappropriately low resolution. Do not use raster figures for your images, use vector formats: eps or pdf (zoom in Fig.~\ref{fig:completeenergy} to see how great vector format looks like.). If you cannot print a true vector figure, increase the resolution of all raster figures to at least 600 dpi. Journals do not accept anything raster images with the resolution lower than 300 dpi.
%RZK0415: I am not sure about the relevance of the NEB profiles in the figures. If we never discuss the shapes of the profiles then we should report only energies of the initial, transition and product states. If only the three states are reported on the energy profile, then it is NOT necessary to repeat data from the main energy figure.
%RZK0415: The energy profile mostly duplicates the main figure. I suppose it should be moved to SI. Without the energy graph the figure fits into one column. The top-view figure contains edge effects, which is highly undesirable. The side-view does not need four layers. All states should be labeled in the corner of the slab.

Fig.~\ref{fig:dissociation_Br} shows the structures of the initial, transition and final states for the debromination of the physisorbed bromobenzene on Cu(111). These state are labeled as \textbf{PHYS}, \textbf{DHAL$\ddagger$} and \textbf{DHAL} in Fig.~\ref{fig:completeenergy}. Dechlorination and deiodination have similar energy and geometry change trend (see supporting information for the figures of dechlorination and deiodination).

}{\color{blue}

[RZK0317: The logic of the paragraph below is not clear]

The energy change of the dehalogenation step is computed to be \SI{-0.58}{\electronvolt}, \SI{-0.80}{\electronvolt} and \SI{-0.94}{\electronvolt} for chlorobenzene, bromobenzene and iodobenzene, respectively. [RZK0317: Unlike analogous reactions in the solution?], dehalogenation reactions on the copper surface are all exothermic. [RZK:] DFT results have demonstrated that the energy barrier of nucleophilic substitution of chlorobenzene and bromobenzene in solution are \SI{1.11}{\electronvolt} and \SI{1.18}{\electronvolt}~\cite{ullmann_86}. The discrepancy in energy indicates that the dehalogenation reaction should go through different mechanisms on Cu(111) surface and in solution. 
Contrary to surface-confined condition, dehalogenation of bromobenzene and iodobenzene in gas phase require \SI{3.85}{\electronvolt} and \SI{3.33}{\electronvolt} energy to accomplish~\cite{jacs2013}. This means copper surface can denote electrons to and stabilize dissociated species, which will make this reaction energetically favourable on Cu(111).  

}{\lock

RZK0422: The barriers below and in the Table do not agree.

The energy barrier of the dehalogenation on surface decreases from chlorobenzene (\SI{1.25}{\electronvolt}) to bromobenzene (\SI{0.92}{\electronvolt}) and to iodobenzene (\SI{0.68}{\electronvolt}). This trend is in agreement with the trend of experimentally measured temperatures required to complete dehalogenation. On Cu(111), iodobenzene has been observed to dissociate at \SI{175}{\kelvin}~\cite{ullmann_87} while bromobenzene dissociates at \SI{160}{\kelvin}~\cite{ullmann_67}. There is no data the dehalogenation temperature of chlorobenzene, but it can be inferred from the existing data on dihalogenated precursors (Table~\ref{table:exp-temp}) that chlorobenzene dissociates at significantly higher temperature than both bromobenzene and iodobenzene. 

RZK0317: Bell-Evans-Polanyi principle?

It should be noted that the dehalogenation of bromobenzene and iodobenzene on Cu(111) has been investigated previously~\cite{jacs2013} using optB86b exchange-correlation functional and smaller slab size, the molecular orientation on Cu(111) is identical with our model. The energy change and barrirer of this step are \SI{-0.70}{\electronvolt} (bromobenzene), \SI{-0.82}{\electronvolt} (iodobenzene) and \SI{0.72}{\electronvolt} (bromobenzene)  RZK: the correct value appears to be 0.66 eV, \SI{0.40}{\electronvolt} (iodobenzene).
%RZK0317: Any comments? (ZZ: added)
%RZK0415: Did they study the same orientation of the molecule? (ZZ: yes, almost the same)
ZZ added: The trend of enthalpy and activation energy data for different halogens are consistent with our conclusion, the difference between enthalpy and activation energy are also close to our results, which could be supported by Bell-Evans-Polanyi principle. The slight difference in the energy value can be interpreted by different functional usage and our larger slab model for computation.

%RZK0317: In the paragraph below, more numerical data must be presented in a Table and less in the text. Text should discuss main trends. (ZZ: added table)

Selected geometric parameters of the intermediates summarized in Table~\ref{table:bondlength}. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dissociation_Br}, the distances between carbon and halogen which are going to break a covalent bond, the angle of phenyl ring with respect to surface are both suffering successively changes. In \textbf{PHYS} of halobenzene, the distances between carbon and halogen are consistent with the calculated bond length of C--Cl (\SI{1.76}{\angstrom}), C--Br (\SI{1.91}{\angstrom}) C--I (\SI{2.14}{\angstrom})in gas phase based on B3LYP functional DFT calculations. These distances will show a continued growth till \textbf{DHAL} states, and dissociated halogen atoms occupy the hollow site on Cu(111) surface in the end of dehalogenation. Interestingly, in the \textbf{DHAL$\ddagger$} transition states of all three halobenzene precursors, C--X distance shows a consistent approximately \SI{0.5}{\angstrom} longer than C--X in \textbf{PHYS}, suggesting that different dehalogenation reactions on Cu(111) follow identical mechanism.
The phenyl ring part of three halobenzenes are all mostly parallel to surface with adsorbed on copper before the dehalogenation. And in the dissociation, the phenyl ring starts to become tilt on surface, then finalize at a large slope. This indicates that the unsaturated carbon atom is interacting with copper atom in Cu(111) during the dehalogenation process. The interaction also changes the distance between the unsaturated carbon and the copper atom involved in dehalogenaiton from different values in \textbf{PHYS} to the same \SI{2.01}{\angstrom} in \textbf{DHAL} states, and the copper atom involved in dehalogenation are all raised by \SI{0.10}{\angstrom} from their original positions. The same C--Cu distance in the end of dehalogenation of chlorobenzene, bromobenzene and iodobenzene suggest that the dissociated halogen atoms have little effect on the interaction of unsaturated carbon and copper atoms. However, halogen atoms have a much larger influence on phenyl ring, resulting in different tilt angles of dehalogenated aromatic species, deiodinated phenyl ring is inclined around \SI{70}{\degree} to metal surface, larger than debrominated and dechlorinated phenyl rings both at around \SI{50}{\degree}.

{\color{blue}

The energy of the adatom formation during the dehalogenation step can be compared to the high \SI{1.76}{\electronvolt} energy of the adatom extraction on the clean metal surface (Fig.~\ref{fig:completeenergy}, RYK-green pathway). The extraction on the clean surface has higher/lower/similar activation energy of \SI{2.04}{\electronvolt} than/to . On the clean surface, the extracted adatom is located at the RYZ site (Fig.~S\ref{SI-fig:cleanatomform}). Compare to the dehalogenation geometry. And so on.

{\color{blue}

Summarizing the data of the first step, Cu(111) surface has been proven to evidently reduce the energy barrier of the dehalogenation of chlorobenzene, bromobenzene and iodobenzene. The copper surface can not only serve as a template and support for Ullmann coupling reaction, but also optimize the temperature condition for it to initialize. On Cu(111), the dehalogenation of iodobenzene is the most energetically favourable and chlorobenzene is the least. The mechanisms of three different halogens dissociation are very similar according to the angles and distance change in related species.

\subsection{Formation of C--Cu--C bridge intermediates}

{\color{blue}
%\lock

The energies of forming the C--Cu--C bridge intermediate (annotated as \textbf{CMC} in Fig.~\ref{fig:completeenergy}) from dehalogenated species on Cu(111) surface are expected to be the same for different halogens, the calculated energies are slightly different: \SI{0.25}{\electronvolt}, \SI{0.16}{\electronvolt} and \SI{0.17}{\electronvolt} for chlorinated, brominated and iodinated benzenes, respectively. The minor differences are due to the halogen atoms still stay proximity to the organic fragments in \textbf{DHAL-2} states, the interaction between them affects the initial states (\textbf{DHAL-2}) of forming C--Cu--C bridge intermediates.

%}{\color{blue}

\textbf{DHAL-2} states used here is well matched to the experiment STM image, as in Fig.~\ref{fig:organ}, the dissociated bromine atoms all sit around in the formation of phenyl--Cu--phenyl structures. Generally the reaction from two dehalogenated precursor to C--Cu--C bridge intermediate is endothermic, but the energy change is relatively small and consistent with the experimental condition shown in Table.~\ref{fig:temp}, dehalogenation and formation of C--Cu--C intermediate structure commonly complete at same temperature. The exception is gold surfaces, on which these intermediates are not observed because they immediately proceed to form C--C bonds~\cite{ullmann_93, ullmann_100, ullmann_101, ullmann_102} with a very low activation energy~\cite{ullmann_33, ullmann_102, ullmann_103, jacs2011}. 

In the \textbf{CMC} configuration, the copper atom interacting with two phenyl rings is lifted from the plane of all other atoms on the ideal surface. This ideal surface atom is raised higher by \SI{0.56}{\angstrom} from the first layer, which is much larger than the height due to one phenyl species extraction in \textbf{DHAL-2} (\SI{0.10}{\angstrom}). %It can be inferred that the force emerged between one phenyl ring and one copper atom is not adequate to extract this copper out from the surface.

The distance between two carbon atoms in the C--Cu--C bridge is \SI{3.10}{\angstrom}, which is \SI{1.61}{\angstrom} longer than the length of the C--C connecting the two rings in biphenyl. The angle of two phenyl rings connected to the Cu atom with respect to the surface are both \SI{52}{\degree}, this angle is the same as the tilt of a single phenyl in DHAL (\SI{52}{\degree}).

Formation of C--Cu--C bridge structure has been proven to play a significant role in the creation of adatom in surface Ullmann coupling. The interaction is potentially sufficient to extract an ideal surface copper atom out compared to previous steps.

\subsection{Formation of the C--C bond}

{\lock
%In the final step of the Ullmann coupling a C--C bond is formed between two phenyl radicals. 
Two pathways to construct the C--C bond starting from the C--Cu--C bridge intermediate are considered here. 
In the first pathway, the bridge Cu atom returns to its original position in the first metal layer once the C--C bond is formed. 
In the second pathway, the this Cu atom is pulled out from the layer to become an adatom, leaving a vacancy in its original position. 
%The two pathways are discussed separately.
}

\subsubsection{Ideal surface}

{\lock

The energy profile of the first pathway is shown by the RYK-color line in Fig.~\ref{fig:completeenergy} whereas the results of the NEB calculations are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:bondformlift}. The inital, transition and final states of this step are denoted as \textbf{CMC}, \textbf{DIM$\ddagger$} and \textbf{DIM}, respectively.

}{\color{blue}
 
%RZK0324: Do not use E_{barrier}. Write "the energy barrier" instead. 
%RZK0324: It would be better to use "the energy change" instead of $\Delta E$ but sometimes it is ok to use $\Delta E$ to shorten long sentences. 
%RZK0324: Replace all labels with the new ones. 
The energy change and barrier for this step are \SI{-2.00}{\electronvolt} and \SI{0.49}{\electronvolt}, respectively. These values are the same for all halogens because the initial and final model states do not contain halogen atoms. 
This step has also been investigated previously, energy change and barrier are provides as \SI{-1.90}{\electronvolt} and \SI{0.38}{\electronvolt} based on a smaller slab and same PBE exchange-correlation functional~\cite{pccp2010}, another work reported \SI{-1.96}{\electronvolt} and \SI{0.14}{\electronvolt} for energy change and barrier respectively with a smaller slab and optB86b exchange-correlation functional~\cite{jacs2013}.

Experiments have shown that the onset temperature for the final C--C bond-formation step is approximately \SI{300}{\kelvin}~\cite{sur_sci01} (Table~\ref{table:exp-temp}), which is in line with the calculated energy barrier. RZK0324: Details on the agreement with experiment?
 
Cu atom involved in C--Cu--C bridge structure is back to the first layer from \SI{0.56}{\angstrom} height in this step. The distance between two unsaturated carbon atoms starts from \SI{3.10}{\angstrom}, then shortened by \SI{0.82}{\angstrom} in the transition state and finalize at \SI{1.49}{\angstrom}, which is the same as the connecting C--C bond length in biphenyl molecule. The change of this distance is consistent with earlier work~\cite{sur_sci01}. The tilt angle of phenyl ring with respect to copper surface varied from \SI{52}{\degree} to \SI{34}{\degree} and ends in nearly \SI{0}{\degree}.

%R1111: LATER. We need to develop better notation for all chemical species and refer to them consistently.

%R1111: LATER. It is important to discuss the zero-energy for this step. Would it be more informative to use a common zero from the entire energy profile?

\subsubsection{Creation of an adatom}

{\lock

The energy profile of the pathways that leads to the creation of an adatom during the C--C bond-formation step is shown by RYK-red line in Fig.~\ref{fig:completeenergy}. The path contains three elementary steps: the adatom extraction, C--C bond formation at the adatom, and diffusion of biphenyl away from the adatom. The two intermediates in the three-step process are denoted as \textbf{X-CMC}, \textbf{X-DIM-A}, whereas the final product is labeled as \textbf{X-DIM-B}. The first two transition states are denoted as \textbf{X-CMC$\ddagger$}, \textbf{X-DIM$\ddagger$}.

}{\color{blue}

Fig.~\ref{fig:bondformadatom} shows trajectory from \textbf{CMC} to the C--Cu--C bridge intermediates, followed by formation of dimer on top of the newly formed adatom (\textbf{X-DIM-A})with a fully extracted Cu adatom (\textbf{X-CMC}). The coupling procedure is divided into two elementary steps in this path. In \textbf{X-CMC} and \textbf{X-DIM-A}, there is a vacancy on the original location of newly formed adatom. 
In the first step of extracting an adatom out by \textbf{X-CMC} bridge intermediate, energy change and barrier are \SI{-0.20}{\electronvolt} and \SI{1.38}{\electronvolt}. The distance between two carbons forming C--Cu--C bridge increases to \SI{3.89}{\angstrom} (in \textbf{X-CMC}) from \SI{3.10}{\angstrom}, and cuts down by \SI{0.34}{\angstrom} in the \textbf{X-CMC$\ddagger$}. The tilt angle flattens to \SI{13}{\degree} from \SI{34}{\degree}.

%%% Late steps
%R1111: What effect is responsible for the energy lowering upon adatom creation in IM5? Note that for I--Ph on Cu the extraction+diffusion during the C-I breaking step produces the overall uphill step. PRIORITY1. Remove Ph in IM3, IM4, IM without geometry relaxation (only the metal surface, not phenyl).

In the second step of forming C--C bond with newly formed adatom, energy change and barrier are \SI{-0.17}{\electronvolt} and \SI{2.01}{\electronvolt}. It ends in the formation of a new covalent C--C with a bond length at \SI{1.50}{\angstrom}, the former distance between these two carbons is \SI{3.10}{\angstrom} in \textbf{X-CMC}, and condenses by \SI{0.57}{\angstrom} in \textbf{X-DIM$\ddagger$}. The tilt angle in \textbf{X-DIM-A} is a little twisted to \SI{-9.1}{\degree}. The configuration of biphenyl should be a nearly plane structure, this can be explained by the fact that the new formed C--C is directly on the top of fully extracted Cu adatom. The distance from the Cu adatom to formed C--C bond is \SI{1.66}{\angstrom}, leading to the repulsion force and distort the two phenyl ring to such a degree.
This path will finally reach the state where a new adatom, a vacancy spot and a biphenyl form on copper surface. Ideally there are no interaction among these three species (\textbf{X-DIM-B}). The energy of \textbf{X-DIM-B} is increased by \SI{0.14}{\electronvolt} compared to \textbf{X-DIM-A}.

Besides, we also investigated the effect of Ullmann coupling intermediates on creation of adatoms, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:onlysurface}. The bottom line shows the potential energy of \textbf{DHAL-2}, \textbf{CMC} and \textbf{X-CMC} in Fig.~\ref{fig:completeenergy}. The surface configuration of these three intermediates are separately taken out from the system and perform a single point energy calculation, the results are displayed in the top line. The energy of copper surface increased by \SI{1.48}{\electronvolt} from \textbf{CMC} to \textbf{X-CMC}, but the potential energy of \textbf{X-CMC} is \SI{0.20}{\electronvolt} lower than from \textbf{CMC}, this means that the interaction between two phenyl species and the ideal surface Cu is strong to extract the Cu atom out of first layer, and even lead to a more stable state on potential energy surface.

\subsubsection{Path I vs path II}

{\color{blue}
The possibility of path I and path II are compared in multi-dimension.
The potential energy data and simplified geometry are present in Fig.~\ref{fig:completeenergy}. Two mechanism start to vary from \textbf{CMC}, path red is both kinetically and thermodynamically more favourable due to a lower-energy transition state and more stable product. This means at the same temperature condition, the reaction indicated in path I will take place at a higher speed and account for a larger percentage. In experiment, phenyl radical species require temperature at \SI{350}{\kelvin} to form C--C bonds on Cu(111) surface, this is more or less corresponding to a higher activation energy than \SI{0.49}{\electronvolt} obtained in path I, this can be explained by the fact that all energy diagram are collected from potential energy, instead of free energy. Under a constant pressure, free activation energy will reflect authentic reaction condition. Taking the entropy contribution into consideration, the energy barrier should be a little larger.

However, the evidence in geometry provides a different result. In experiment, the distance between two carbons in C--Cu--C bridge structure is \SI{4.5}{\angstrom} \textpm\ \SI{0.6}{\angstrom} based on the STM image of this bridge intermediates. This corresponds to the distance in \textbf{X-CMC} of path II, which is \SI{3.89}{\angstrom}, and this distance in \textbf{CMC} is \SI{3.10}{\angstrom}. This means that the C--Cu--C intermediates is more likely to possess an adatom in nature, this adatom is either from an ideal surface or it is an pre-existing adatom.

Taking the reaction condition into consideration. The temperature of final forming C--C bond from two phenyl species need to go up to above \SI{350}{\kelvin}~\cite{sur_sci01}. The activation energy of \textbf{CMC} evolved to \textbf{DIM$\ddagger$} in green line and to TS-r1 in red line are \SI{0.38}{\electronvolt} and \SI{1.37}{\electronvolt}, respectively. The experimental temperature can meet the requirement of both two paths, but the reaction in path II will occur with a higher speed.

RZK0422: The alternative transition states must be described. What is the energy barrier with the alternative TS compared to that with X-DIM-ddagger?

}

%R1111: Compare C--C distance in IM4 and IM5 to the experimental data for Ph-Halogen. Can we see IM5 experimentally? 3.89Ang vs 3.1Ang. (%ZZ: Added)


%R1111: Note that the difference between dimer1 and dimer2 is smaller than the difference between FS1 and IS. Probably because the dimer interacts stronger with the adatom than with the surface. 


\subsection{Desorption of products}

Although the desorption of the reaction products is not observed experimentally [RZK0422: is this true?] it is worth looking at its energetics.
 
{\color{blue}

Apart from the intermediates discussed above, we consider the desoprtion of all species on copper surface after the completion of Ullmann coupling reaction. Energy change of desorping formed biphenyl molecule is \SI{1.72}{\electronvolt}, and of desorping two chlorine atoms, two bromine atoms and two iodine atoms are \SI{3.33}{\electronvolt}, \SI{4.01}{\electronvolt} and \SI{4.66}{\electronvolt}. 

RZK0422: As suggested before, calculate the energy of PROD state and report desorption energy of Halogen$_2$ molecule, not two separate atoms.

}

RZK0422: The meaning of the following sentence is unclear. 
Here taking the surface Ullmann coupling between two bromobenzene as example, the physisorption of two bromobenzene on Cu(111) surface decrease the energy of the whole system by 2.35 eV, which is widely recognized in experiment because adsorbing aromatic species on copper surface as a fast procedure. 

The last two successive steps are concerned with the desorption of biphenyl molecule and two dehalogenated bromine atoms. 
In total, the red line is more energetically favourable than green line, that can be considered to be a more reasonable pathway in realistic surface Ullmann coupling if there is no pre-exiting adatom on metal surface.

%%% Early steps
%R1111: LATER. Do we need adatom calculations for TS1? Perhaps only one or two halogen-metal pairs (for complete diagram). How will it affect the subsequent steps? Will the PH-Adatom roam the surface together before encountering the second Ph? PRIORITY6.

%R1111: Why there is no Cu-atom lifting during the C-X bond dissociation? Compare to previous works. Actually partial lifting is a process with a barrier for Au and Ag surfaces but not for Cu. We might need to reproduce this after all. --> More comparison to the existing calculation is required.

%RZK1222: This important effect needs to be properly described. The height of TS2-1 means that IM5, once formed will not undergo the C--C bond formation and can be viewed as an undesirable by-product of the reaction (unless it exists in quick equilibrium with IM4, which can be entropically hindered -- hard to find that vacancy again).

%RZK1222: How difficult is it to push the adatom (with attached organic radicals) DOWN?

\subsection{Coupling catalyzed by an existing adatom}

In addition to two paths in surface Ullmann coupling, we also consider the copper atom involved in surface Ullmann coupling is a pre-existing adatom on Cu(111). It is a superficial evaluation since in the calculations, a vacancy always exsits next to the adatom, the interaction between the adatom and the vacancy has been ignored to presume an adatom has formed on Cu(111) before any surface Ullmann coupling related species are adsorbed.

In the diagram, the initial state (0 energy state), Cu(111) with an adatom and vacancy is different from the one in previous calculation (non-defect surface). Thermodynamically it can be concluded that \SI{5.73}{\electronvolt} heat will be released in a completion of surface Ullmann coupling with a pre-exsting adatom on Cu(111). It is a energetically favorable and exothermic process, which can be considered as a highly plausible pathway due to non-defect metal surface in nature. 

\begin{figure*}[hbt]

\label{fig:adatomullmann}
\end{figure*}

RZK0422: Can an existing adatom revert back to its original ``clean'' form to catalyze another event? It does not look plausible. First, adatom-coordinated species are anchored to the adatom too strongly to simply diffuse away. Examples. Second, adatom-coordinated species cannot react with the sufficiently low barrier to produce weakly adsorbed products. Example: C--C bond formation is hindered by the high activation barrier. C--Halogen bond formation?

\section{Entropy correction and free energy calculation}

An unignorable disagreement exits between the experimental data and our DFT results. The calculated energy barrier of dehalogenation is \SI{0.89}{\electronvolt} (\textbf{PHYS}-\textbf{DHAL$\ddagger$}), which is  higher than the energy barrier from two dehalogenated phenyls to the biphenyl (\textbf{DHAL-2}-\textbf{DIM$\ddagger$}). In experiment, the latter step always require a higher temperature to accomplish than dehalogenation step, which has been validated by the data in Table.~\ref{fig:temp}. This issue has also been observed in other works~\cite{jacs2013, pccp2010}. We are considering this general discrepancy aroused from the ignorance of entropy in theoretical calculations. 

DFT calculations make a useful contribution to elucidating the mechanism behind the adsorption of molecules on surface, and allow precise prediction on energy and geometry. However, DFT calculations are basically limited to \SI{0}{\kelvin} temperature, describing potential energy and trend, instead of free energy change. Specifically in surface Ullman coupling reaction, the formation of dimer consists of the combination of two dehalogenated species, which will lead to an effective decrease in entropy and make a non-negligible contribution to free energy change. Thus, to bridge the gap between experiments and simulation data in surface Ullmann coupling at finite temperature, entropy must be taken into consideration. 

Here the free energy diagram (Fig.\ref{fig:entropy}) is obtained after the entropy correction is done to our previous potential energy data. We treated three dimensional free gas molecules and two dimensional adsorbed species both with transnational motion exclusively, the temperature condition for all species are at \SI{200}{\kelvin} and \SI{400}{\kelvin}, respectively labeled in Fig.\ref{fig:entropy}, pressure of gas molecule is $10^{-10}$ mba, which is widely used ultra high vacuum condition in surface Ullmann coupling, and the concentration of adsorbed molecules is \SI{10e-16}{\per\metre\squared}, which is validated by STM image in Ref.~\cite{ullmann_67}. Details are discussed in Supplementary Information.

Zero energy state is fluctuated up in free energy due to including the entropy correction of gas bromobenzene. At \SI{400}{\kelvin}, the free energy barrier stay unchanged as \SI{0.89}{\electronvolt}, while the free energy barrier from \textbf{DHAL-2} to \textbf{DIM$\ddagger$} changes to \SI{1.09}{\electronvolt} from previous \SI{0.66}{\electronvolt}. The energy required for C--C coupling from two dehalogenated species has effectively increased in free energy calculations, which is further matched with the experimentally higher temperature in second step.

Our study suggests that the entropy contribution to free energy will affect the process of surface Ullmann coupling.The entropy calculation depends much on surface coverage, temperature and pressure, a highly consistent reaction condition parameter setup will allow more accurate results in DFT calculations. However, our model for two dimensional lattice adsorption is a superficial model, aimed at providing insight into narrowing the gap between theoretical calculation and experiment.

\section{Conclusions}
We have systematically studied the surface Ullmann coupling reaction of chlorobenzene, bromobenzene and iodobenzene on commonly employed Cu(111) surface with computation methods. Also the role of metal atom involved in each elementary step of forming biphenyl molecule are studied. Mainly the energy and molecular geometry of two different pathways: (1) a partially lifted up copper atom takes part in the formation of C--Cu--C bridge structure and back to it original position in first layer of surface with the construction of new C--C bond; (2) a copper atom and a vacancy is formed by fully extraction of C--Cu--C bridge structure, and a new adatom is created with forming C--C bond on copper surface are compared based on DFT calculation results. A simple discussion on the circumstance that an adatom exists before the surface Ullmann coupling occurs and interact with coupling-related species has also been constructed.

The effect of different halogens mostly agree with the results descried in previous works. It can be concluded that halogens will mainly influence the dehalogenation step and produce little effect on later steps. After forming C--Cu--C bridge intermediate structure, the path of partially lifting ideal surface atom is much more energetically favorable both in thermodynamics and kinetics, compared with the path of creating a new adatom. This suggests that Ullmann coupling on copper surface is more likely to occur through a non-adatom formation pathway, the metal atom will be partially lifted up while the C--Cu--C organometallic intermediates forms and back to its original position after completing the coupling reaction. However, it is also worthwhile to mention that the possibility that adatoms will take part in the Ullmann coupling process should not be ruled out. The heat released from the hehalogenation step is sufficient to compensate either C--C coupling through a non-adatom surface metal atom or through an adatom creating path. It means both of these two procedure can occur in nature but occupy different proportions and proceed in different velocity.

The path that adatom already exists from thermal fluctuation or defect before the coupling is roughly discussed. Pre-existing adatom can be regarded as a exceedingly plausible source for organometallic intermediates in surface Ullmann coupling on metal surface.
