\subsection{Ullmann coupling in solution}

In 1901, Fritz Ullmann discovered~\cite{ullmann_01} a coupling reaction that creates a C--C bond between aryl halide molecules in the presence of a stoichiometric amount of Cu powder. 
%Currently, the scope of Ullmann coupling reaction is being widened with an increasing number of substrates, leaving groups, and active metal species being investigated for constructing various C--X bonds. 
Because of its ability to form C--C bonds, Ullmann coupling has become one of the key reactions in organic synthesis with its scope extended to new reactants and catalysts. 
Today, the \emph{classical} Ullmann or simply Ullmann reaction refers to a family of nucleophilic substitution reactions between aromatic nucleophiles that proceed in the presence of copper and lead to the formation of C--C and C--heteroatom bonds such as C--N~\cite{ullmann_02, ullmann_03}, C--O~\cite{ullmann_04}, C--S~\cite{ullmann_05} and C--P~\cite{ullmann_21,ullmann_22} bonds (Fig.~\ref{fig:UllmannCoupling}). 
%RZZK: In Ullmann coupling, metals can serve as reactants or as catalysts.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.90\columnwidth]{Fig/classical.png}
\caption{Examples of the Ullmann coupling reactions.}
\label{fig:UllmannCoupling}
\end{figure}

Depending on the type of bonds created, reactants in the Ullmann coupling can be aromatic amines~\cite{ullmann_17,ullmann_18}, amides~\cite{ullmann_19,ullmann_20}, phosphines~\cite{ullmann_21,ullmann_22}, carboxylic acids~\cite{ullmann_23}, diaryl ethers~\cite{ullmann_24}, phenols~\cite{ullmann_25} and other oxygen-containing species~\cite{ullmann_26,ullmann_27,ullmann_28}. 
While halides, especially iodides and bromides served as typical leaving groups, the usage of the tosylate leaving group has also been reported~\cite{ullmann_15}. 
Cu-containing compounds are most widely used as activating agents. In addition to traditional Cu(0), different Cu(I) and Cu(II) salts and oxides -- including CuI~\cite{ullmann_07,ullmann_08,ullmann_09}, CuBr~\cite{ullmann_10,ullmann_11}, CuCl~\cite{ullmann_13}, Cu$_2$O~\cite{ullmann_12}, Cu(acca)$_2$~\cite{ullmann_14}, Cu(OTf)$_2$~\cite{ullmann_15}, CuO~\cite{ullmann_16} -- have been used {\color{blue}as well}. 
Apart from Cu agents, Pd nanocomplexes~\cite{ullmann_35, ullmann_36}  have been proven \underline{to participate}
{\color{blue}effective}
in the Ullmann coupling reaction. 

Ullmann coupling has been acquiring greater significance in the last decade because Cu is a cheaper alternative to Pd, Pt and Rh, because halogen side-product can be avoided and because air or oxygen can act as oxidants~\cite{ullmann_38,ullmann_39,ullmann_40,ullmann_41}. Despite widespread applications, Ullmann reaction suffers from several limitations including the necessity of high temperature and polar solvents with high boiling point, low solubility of many Cu compounds, erratic yields, and poor functional group tolerance leading to a limited substrate scope~\cite{ullmann_31}. %Apart from this, the usage of Cu does not meet the prerequisite of sustainable development.

The mechanism of classical Ullmann coupling is relatively well understood (Fig.~\ref{fig:classical}).
It is widely accepted that an aryl halides molecule reacts with Cu species to form an organometallic intermediate. This intermediate then reacts with a second aryl molecule through oxidative addition producing a diaryl organomitallic intermediate, which subsequently undergoes reductive elimination to form a covalent bond between the two aryls. 
%The Ullmann coupling reactions discussed above occur mostly in organic solvents.

Recent advances in the classical Ullmann coupling reaction have been reviewed by several authors~\cite{ullmann_29,ullmann_30,ullmann_31,ullmann_32}.

\subsection{Surface Ullmann coupling}

A recent surge of interest in electronic devices based on low-dimensional organic nanostructures with $\pi$-conjugated backbones has led to a renewed attention to the Ullmann coupling reaction. 
In the case of low-dimensional materials, the well-established ability of Ullmann coupling to create bonds between aromatic carbon atoms and couple their $\pi$ systems have been transferred from solution to metal surfaces, which serve as both a low-dimensional confining template and catalyst.

The on-surface Ullmann reaction is currently viewed as a promising bottom-up strategy to assemble, in mild conditions, one- and two-dimensional organic polymers with high degree control of their electronic properties~\cite{ullmann_33}. 
In the context of surface reactions, the term Ullmann coupling has been extended to refer to the reaction on metals other than copper, such as silver and gold. 

One of the first fundamental studies of the surface-confined coupling of iodobenzene to biphenyl under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) condition was reported by Xi and Bent~\cite{sur_sci01} in 1992.
%
The intermediate species of the same reaction were inspected using STM imaging by Weiss \textit{et al.}~\cite{langm01} in 1998. 
In 2004, it was demonstrated that linear \emph{protopolymers}---aligned monomer units of a polymer that have not yet reacted to form the final polymer---could be obtained by depositing \textit{para}-diiodobenzene on Cu(111) at 77 K~\cite{jacs01}. 
This insight showed that the Ullmann coupling can be used not only to synthesize organic molecules but periodic polymers as well.
Remarkably, the first synthesis of covalently-bonded nanostructures from molecular building blocks on metal surfaces under vacuum has employed the Ullmann reaction: the coupling between brominated tetraphenyl-porphyrins on the Au(111) surface was performed by Grill \textit{et al.}~\cite{Naturenano2007} in 2007.

Since then, surface Ullmann coupling has become one of the most representative on-surface synthesis schemes. It has been utilized to create covalently-linked extended aromatic systems on a variety of metal surfaces starting from halogenated aryl precursors~\cite{ullmann_33,ullmann_34, ullmann_42, ullmann_43, ullmann_45, ullmann_46, ullmann_47, ullmann_48}. 

\subsection{Mechanism of surface Ullmann coupling}

Although multiple covalently-bonded nanostructures have been obtained on metal surfaces via Ullmann coupling, our knowledge of the mechanism of the surface processes still remains fragmentary. 
A thorough understanding of the mechanism of surface Ullmann coupling reaction will enable rational, faster, more precise design of the halogenated precursors, well-matched to a chosen metal surface.
The overall coupling process can be divided into elementary steps depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig_mecha} and described in details below. It should be noted that the surface Ullmann coupling proceeds through the formation of the organometallic intermediates similar to those encountered in the reaction in solution (Fig.~\ref{fig:classical}).

The focus of the following review of the Ullmann coupling mechanism is entirely on the formation of a carbon-carbon bond from halogen-containing precursors on Cu, Ag and Au surfaces. A particular attention is paid to the monohalogenated benzenes.

\subsubsection{Dehalogenation}

RZK0108: This subsection needs much more work following the guidelines discussed in December. Trends in experimental data is presented first, desirably for PhX. It would be particularly strong if the trends are discussed across all metals and halogens. Then, discuss if the trends can be reproduced from simple bond-strength models. Then, a short summary of DFT calculation is presented to say if the trend can be reproduced using electronic structure methods.

{\lock

The first fundamental step of surface Ullmann coupling is the dissociative dehalogenation of organic precursors adsorbed on the surface. In this step, the carbon-halogen bonds of the precursor are broken whereas the carbon-metal and halogen-metal bonds are formed. The thermodynamics and kinetics of the process are primarily determined by the relative strength of the broken and formed bonds, shown below. 

}%lock

The following trends in the bond strength have been derived from model molecular systems.
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\begin{split}
\text{C--Cl} > \text{C--Br} > \text{C--I} \\ 
\text{Cu--C} > \text{Au--C} > \text{Ag--C} \\
\text{Cu--Cl} > \text{Cu--Br} > \text{Cu--I}\\
\text{Ag--Cl} \approx \text{Ag--Br} > \text{Ag--I} \\
\text{Au--Cl} > \text{Au--I} > \text{Au--Br}
\end{split}
\end{eqnarray}
%
The bond dissociation energy of diatomic and CX$_4$ molecules have been used in the cases of the metal-halogen bonds~\cite{ullmann_62} and carbon-halogen bonds~\cite{ullmann_63}, respectively. The relative strength of metal-carbon bond strength has been estimated using the metal-carbon bond distances in M-(CH$_3$)$_2$ molecules~\cite{ullmann_61}.

By combining the strength of all metal-halogen bonds shown above the following series emerges
%
\begin{gather*}
\text{Cu--Cl} > \text{Cu--Br} > \text{Au--Cl} \approx \text{Au--I} \approx \text{Ag--Br} \approx \\
 \approx \text{Ag--Cl} > \text{Ag--I} > \text{Au--Br} > \text{Cu--I}
\end{gather*}
%
RZK0108: I do not understand why you are ordering the strength of metal-halogen bonds. It is useless for making prediction of the thermodynamics and kinatics of the first step. We meed to predict the energy of this step: C-X bond is broken, C-M bond is fomred, X-M bond is formed. Has it been done in any review articles?

%RZK0108: What of the two factors influence this step more: the nature of the halogen or the nature of the metal? 
This data illuminates the strong influence of surfaces on the first step of the reaction. % which has been proven in experiment of bromobenzene and iodobenzene. 
For instance, the dissociaton of iodobenzene occurs at $\sim$\SI{175}{\kelvin} on Cu(111)~\cite{sur_sci01}, $\sim$\SI{200}{\kelvin} on Ag(111)~\cite{sur_sci02} and $\sim$\SI{250}{\kelvin} on Au (111)~\cite{sur_sci03}. 
%RZK1221: It is unclear what "occurs" refers to. Dissociation happens even at very low temperature but to a lesser degree. 
%RZK1221: The strengths of bonds actually predict the opposite order in temperatures.
The same trend has been observed for bromobenzene with a higher temperature on all surfaces.
%RZK1221: For Br-Metal, the trend in strength is reversed. How this can be explained?

DFT calculations have estimated the activation barrier for the exothermic dehalogenation of bromobenzene and iodobenzene on (111) metal surfaces to be \SIrange{0.4}{1.0}{\electronvolt}~\cite{jacs2013}. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dehalo}, the activation barrier and reaction energy decrease in the order Au $>$ Ag $>$ Cu and are \SIrange{0.1}{0.5}{\electronvolt} lower for iodobenzene than bromobenzene. The latter is due to the dissociation energy of a C--I bond being $\sim$\SI{0.65}{\electronvolt} lower than that of a C--Br bond~\cite{Arpc1982}.

(c) $E_{barrier}$ (left) and $E_{react}$ (right) for the dissociation of bromobenzene and iodobenzene on the (111) facets of Au, Ag, and Cu.} 
\label{fig:dehalo}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Diffusion}

{\lock

The dehalogenation step produces organometallic intermediates with carbon atoms covalently bonded directly to surface metal atoms. 
The diffusion of these species, which has been observed experimentally and studied computationally, plays a decisive role in the further coupling process. 
A high mobility of molecules increases the chances of two molecules moving closer to each and forming a bond. Therefore, low energy barriers for diffusion process are a prerequisite for the self-assembly of well-ordered networks

Among dehalogenated precursors, the diffusion of a phenyl group has been studied most thoroughly. 
Computational studies have considered sliding or flipping mechanisms of diffusion~\cite{pccp2010, jacs2013}. 
In the sliding diffusion, a phenyl group keeps its orientation to the surface in the initial, transition and final states. The energy barrier of the sliding diffusion on (111)metal surfaces decreases from \SI{0.44}{\electronvolt} on Cu to \SI{0.29}{\electronvolt} on Ag and to \SI{0.22}{\electronvolt} on Au. 
In the flipping diffusion, a phenyl group increases its tilting angle, achieves the upright configuration and then overturns to bind to an adjacent metal atom. 
For this diffusion mechanism, the change in the magnitude of the diffusion barriers follows a different trend and decreases from \SI{0.19}{\electronvolt} on Au to \SIrange{0.07}{0.09}{\electronvolt} on Cu and to \SI{0.06}{\electronvolt} on Ag. 
The low calculated barriers agree with STM studies that have revealed that dehalogenated phenyl groups diffuse on the Cu (111) surface at temperatures as low as \SI{77}{\kelvin}~\cite{langm01}. 

It should be noted that the flipping diffusion may not contribute significantly for larger precursor molecules, especially those anchored to the surface by several covalent bonds. The stronger surface-molecule interaction will favor diffusion mechanism with the molecular plane remaining parallel to the surface~\cite{ullmann_65}.

%RZZK: This is from jacs2013
%Furthermore, the presence of Cu adatoms may impact the self-assembly more than the poor diffusion on the atomically flat Cu(111) surface. These adatoms are known to have a great influence on selfassembly on Cu(111), where in many cases coordination bonds are formed instead of covalent networks.21 The Cu adatoms can also contribute to the covalent bonding of the nanostructure.22,23

Halogen atoms chemisorbed on the surface also undergo the diffusion process. The binding energy of halogens and their diffusion barriers have been investigated using DFT calculations~\cite{jacs2013}, which show that halogens hop between fcc and hcp hollow sites with the transition state being the bridge site. The diffusion barriers for a variety of metal-halogen combinations have been found to be in the \SIrange{0.05}{0.1}{\eV} range, implying that the halogens are highly mobile on the three metal surfaces at experimental temperatures. The barrier tends to be largest on Au(111) and smallest on Cu(111). 

%RZK0122: Should we add the following citation to the previous paragaph?
%There are few experiment works related to the diffusion of halogen atoms on metal surface, but it is much better investigated theoretically using DFT calculations~\cite{ullmann_66}.

%RZK0122: The following data can be added but only as a table, not text.
%Atomic bromine has been reported to have a diffusion energy barrier of \SI{0.09}{\electronvolt}, \SI{0.07}{\electronvolt} and \SI{0.06}{\electronvolt} on Au(111), Ag(111) and Cu(111) respectively. Atomic iodine have a barrier of \SI{0.11}{\electronvolt}, \SI{0.06}{\electronvolt} and \SI{0.06}{\electronvolt} on Au(111), Ag(111) and Cu(111) respectively. And atomic chlorine have a barrier of \SI{0.02}{\electronvolt} and \SI{0.08}{\electronvolt} on Au(111) and Cu(111) respectively. 

}

\subsubsection{Formation of carbon-metal-carbon intermediates} \label{sec:dimerized}
%RZZK: Dimerization??? (%ZZ two organometallic intermediates bond together)

{\lock

Dimerized organometallic intermediates will form when two organic fragments diffuse close to each other and become bound to the same metal atom, without yet creating a direct covalent bond with each other. Since the distance between two carbon atoms in such carbon-metal-carbon bridges is significantly larger than in a covalent bond, their existence has been confirmed in multiple  STM and AFM experimental studies~\cite{jacs2011}, corroborated with computational studies.

STM images of phenyl groups on Cu(111) show that structures consisting of two groups bound to the same metal atom form at \SI{160}{\kelvin} (Fig.~\ref{fig:organ}). The measured geometry of these intermediate structures agree with those obtain from DFT modeling~\cite{ullmann_67}. The activation energy of forming such bridge structures from two single organometallic intermediates has been calculated to be \SI{0.38}{\electronvolt}~\cite{pccp2010}. 
%RZK0122: I cannot find the number you mentioned above in this article. This number means that the formation of dimerized species needs much higher activation energy than simple diffusion. Check this number.

%RZK0122: There is no reference in the following sentence. 
The existence of organometallic bridges has also been demonstrated for dibromoterphenyl on Cu(111) and Ag(111) surfaces at \SI{300}{\kelvin} by a combined STM and DFT study. 
%RZK0122: pDOS can confirm this existence only if combined with experiments. What kind of experiments? Reply in comments, do not re-write the text.
Projected density of states also indicates the existence of C--Cu--C/C--Ag--C bridge structures~\cite{jacs2011, PCCP2012}. 

%RZK0122: Read the paragraph, calrify in the comments, do not re-write text.
The observation of the bridge structures on both metals at \SI{300}{\kelvin} implies that the barrier for [the further C--C bond formation step][OR][the bridge formation] on Ag and Cu surfaces are similar. 
Compared to the dehalogenation, this step [which step? see above] requires generally \SIrange{150}{200}{\kelvin} higher temperature condition (still lower than room temperature). It is remarkable that while organometallic bridges are common on Cu and Ag surfaces they are only occasionally reported on the Au surface [RZK: reference]. This phenomenon is explained by a relatively low energy barrier for the C--C bond formation between precursors on the Au surface that results in a very short life-time of the bridges~\cite{ullmann_33}.

\subsubsection{Formation of the C--C bond}

{\lock

%RZK0122: Annealing can have different meaning. Use simpler word(s).
After further annealing[increase/decrease/changes in temperature], a covalent C--C bond is formed spontaneously and irreversibly between the two organic precursors anchored to the same metal atom. The structural changes in this elementary step as well as its energetics have been extensively studied using experiments and simulations.

} %lock

It has been reported~\cite{jacs2016} that the dimerization and trimerization of 1,4-dibromobenzene on Cu(100) in UHV condition and related simulations with DFT methods. DFT results show that the dimerized organometallic intermediate is a  stable phase in the potential energy surface. A 0.7 eV of activation energy was required from the dimerized organometallic intermediate to the coupling dimer. And a 0.2 eV of activation was needed for the coupling dimer to produce the trimer product, the data could be reviewed in Fig.~\ref{fig:dimer}. 
%RZK1221: Again, you give to many irrelevant details for a short review. If the 2013 work gives the same results, combine it with the previous sentence.
These data are consistent with Di Giovannantonio's another experiment work~\cite{acsnano2013} in 2013. Same precursor 1,4-dibromobenzene was deposited on Cu(100) surface and the surface Ullmann coupling process was pictured in STM image. It was reported that organometallic intermediates were formed at room temperature, nevertheless the final formation of C--C bond needed an annealing temperature up to 500 K.

The colors of the frames correspond to the arrows in panels a and f.}
%\label{fig:dimer}
%\end{figure*}
%

%RZK1221: Higher than what?
%RZK1212: Is it important what surface? 111 or other or it does not matter.
This final step requires a higher annealing temperature, ranging from 330 to 420~K on Ag surface and from 500 to 600~K on Au surface~\cite{ullmann_51}. On Cu, the temperature range is usually lower than on Au but higher than on Ag. This indicates that the energy barrier of the formation of C--C bond step on three metal surfaces should follow Au $>$ Cu $>$ Ag. 
%RZK1221: Is it your speculation? If yes, it should be in Results and Discussion. If not, a reference should be given. 
And since there were limited reports on the formation of C-Au-C intermediates, it could be safely speculated that a high energy barrier exists in the formation of C-Au-C dimerized organometallic intermediates and a low barrier exists in the covalent bond formation. 

{\color{blue}

Biphenyl products are reported to form from two phenyl groups at \SI{350}{\kelvin} on Cu(111) surface in experiment~\cite{ullmann_68, ullmann_69}. DFT calculation also demonstrates the energy change and energy barrier for this step~\cite{jacs2013}. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:coupling}, the energy change of forming biphenyl on difference metal surface decreases in the order Ag $>$ Au $>$ Cu, and the energy barrier decreases in the order Ag $>$ Cu $>$ Au. The formation the C--C bond for two phenyl groups appears to be highly exothermic for all surfaces.

The energies are given with respect to the most stable adsorption configuration of an isolated phenyl on the respective surface.}
\label{fig:coupling}
\end{figure}

More types of molecules were also reported, such as the dimerization and trimerization of 1,4-dibromobenzene on Cu(100) surface. DFT calculations shows that the activation energy of formation of C--C bond in dimer and trimer are \SI{0.7}{\electronvolt} and \SI{0.2}{\electronvolt}, respectively~\cite{jacs2016}. This value is consistent with the experiment temperature condition for dimerization of 1,4-dibromobenzene, typically \SI{500}{\kelvin} is required for this molecule to construct a C--C bond on Cu(100).
%RZK1221: Higher than what?
%RZK1212: Is it important what surface? 111 or other or it does not matter.

In general, this final step requires the highest annealing temperature in surface Ullmann coupling process. Like for dihalobenzene (halo = Cl, Br or I) precursor on Cu(110), the formation of C--C bond requires a temperature ranging from \SIrange{410}{450}{\kelvin}, which is higher than the temperature needed to process the dehalogenation in the range from \SIrange{170}{370}{\kelvin}~\cite{ullmann_44}. On other type of Cu surface, as well on Ag and on Au surface, a higher annealing temperature for C--C coupling has also been reported than dehalogenation steps~\cite{ Naturenano2007, ullmann_70, ullmann_71}. 

%This indicates that the energy barrier of the formation of C--C bond step on three metal surfaces should decrease in the order Au $>$ Cu $>$ Ag.

%RZK1221: Is it your speculation? If yes, it should be in Results and Discussion. If not, a reference should be given.(%ZZ: will discuss in result part)
%And since there were limited reports on the formation of C--Au--C intermediates, it could be safely speculated that a high energy barrier exists in the formation of C-Au-C dimerized organometallic intermediates and a low barrier exists in the covalent bond formation.

With the formation of C--C bond, a surface Ullmann coupling would be completed between two monomers, resulting in a dimer. If there are more than one functional groups on a monomer, this dimer could further diffuse and couple to obtain a trimer~\cite{jacs2016}, and oligomers~\cite{ullmann_53, ullmann_56} or polymers~\cite{ullmann_43, ullmann_54, ullmann_55}.


\subsubsection{Summary on mechanism of surface Ullmann Coupling}

%RZK: This is from pccp2010
For instance, at sub-monolayer coverage, the C6H5–I dissociation occurs at 175 K on Cu(111), [5,6] at 200–250 K on Au(111) [9] and below 200 K on Ag(111) [8]. By contrast, the biphenyl formation temperatures are higher on Cu(111) (over 300 K) [5,6], and lower on Au(111) (165--180 K) [9] and on Ag(111) (110 K) [4].

{\color{blue}
Overall, the effect of halogens and metal types on each step of surface Ullmann coupling reaction mechanism have been exhaustively explored. 

On dehalogenation step, it has been shown that the reactivity trend decrease in the order Ar--I $>$ Ar--Br $>$ Ar--Cl both in experiment and theoretically~\cite{ullmann_52}. This also means that the dissociation of Ar--I bond on metal surface requires the lowest temperature. In addition, the energy barrier of dehalogenation is the highest on Au(111) surface, the lowest on Cu(111) surface both in experiment and in theoretical calculations~\cite{jacs2013}. It has also reported that the miller index of metal surface will also influence the reaction energy of dehalogenation~\cite{ullmann_57}. 

Then considering the next step, it has been discussed that the diffusion of phenyl group on Au(111) surface is the most energetically favorable, while on Ag(111) is the least. The halogens are supposed to have little influence on the diffusion step, but it might hinder the two phenyl group to diffuse close to each other. 

When it comes to the formation of C--M--C bridge intermediates, it is concluded that C--Au--C structure is the hardest to obtain, the construction of C--Ag--C and C--Cu--C should have close energy barrier due to the similar temperature condition of this step in experiments. 

The covalent bond formation is the last step, different precursors will complete the C--C construction at various annealing temperature on different surfaces. The certain point is this step requires the highest temperature in the whole surface Ullmann coupling procedure.

%RZK1220: What comes next is not relevant to diffusion. Should be discussed in the summary of the mechanism. Or perhaps create a separate subsection "Desorption"
Besides, as we mentioned in the diffusion section that the energy barrier for halogens to diffuse on all metal surfaces are very low, which means halogens may have a high mobility after dissociation. Although halogens are free to move, they possess a relatively high binding energy to metals. The lowest binding energy is halogens on Au(111), around \SI{2.8}{\electronvolt} and the highest is on Cu(111), around \SI{3.1}{\electronvolt}, which indicates that the halogens are even harder to desorb than those dehalogenated phenyl groups. Research also showed that the halogens remained on metal surface will further hinder the diffusion, coupling and polymerization of all kinds of phenyl species~\cite{ullmann_64,ullmann_65}. Removing the byproducts of on-surface Ullmann coupling is also of great significance.

In the process of Ullmann coupling, reactants, intermediates and final products interact directly with metal atoms on the surface and, therefore, are affected by surface defects. Quantifying the extent to which imperfections of the metal surface influence the thermodynamics and kinetics of the Ullmann coupling can suggest new strategies for surface optimization, leading, in turn, to higher yields of desirable perfectly-organized [defect-free] two-dimensional polymers.

Surface metal atoms that affect and participate in the Ullmann coupling have different \emph{nature} and \emph{origins}.
Atom's nature describes its immediate environment. Atoms located in the first layer of atoms of the ideal surface will be referred to as \emph{ideal-surface} atoms. \emph{Adatoms}, according to the commonly accepted definition, lie on top of the layer of ideal-surface atoms. In this work, adatoms are differentiated according to their \emph{origin} and can be \emph{pre-existing} and \emph{extracted} adatoms. The origin of pre-existing atoms is irrelevant, not specified, or not known. Extracted adatoms, on the other hand, are known to have been lifted from their lattice sites and placed on top of the surface leaving a surface vacancy behind. In this work, \emph{vacancy} refers exclusively to vacant lattice positions on the surface, not in the bulk.
%RZZK: This section might be better placed into Definitions/Notation part of the manuscript.
%RZZK: The talk about nature and origins is perhaps too formalized. I will simplify it later later.

%%%Here the two terminology $Nature$ and $Origin$ will be used to distinguish the metal atoms which participate in suface Ullmann coupling.
%%%The $Nature$ of metal atoms means metal atoms can come from (1) surface atom which is located at the first layer on metal surface, is indistinguishable from other surface atoms and has no relation with surface defect, or (2) adatoms which is related to the surface defect, it will lie above the first layer of metal surface and free to diffuse.
%%%Thus, the $nature$ mainly divide the metal atoms from a surface into two categories, the first kind is indistinguishable and locate in the lattice of metal crystal, while the second kind is adatoms, which is a production of common non-order defect appeared on metal surface. 
%%%The process that gives birth to $nature(2)$, adatoms in surface Ullmann coupling reaction is also of great interest. It can be split into two different kinds with notation $origin$: adatoms in surface Ullmann coupling may come from (1) pre-exsiting adatoms before the occurrence of surface Ullmann coupling due to the surface defect, thermal punctuation or (2)pulled out by the intermediates produced in surface Ullmann coupling, and then fully sit above the first layer of metal surface to become a new adatom. For the second origin of adatoms, it can also be expressed that the surface Ullmann coupling create this adatom which used to be a $nature(1)$ atom.

{\color{blue}

The nature of metal atoms and the origin of adatoms have been explored experimentally and computationally.
%For origin(1), it has been reported that the onset of the vacancy-adatom formation take place on Cu(111) surface was around 900 K by molecular dynamics~\cite{ullmann_50} , which is much higher than the temperature required by surface Ullmann coupling reaction, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:2Dgasn}~\cite{ullmann_50}. This could be the evidence that there would not be new adatoms formation due to the thermal fluctuations as the surface Ullmann coupling proceeds. 

%discuss that adatoms could exit on metal surface due to the thermal evaporation
For \emph{pre-existing} adatoms, it has been explored that Cu adatoms can be released on Cu(111) surface by thermal activation~\cite{ullmann_79, ullmann_58}, silver and gold adatoms can be released on silver and gold surface respectively as well~\cite{ullmann_84, ullmann_85}, especially near surface defects. These adatoms have also been previously observed to
participate in metal organic coordination networks~\cite{ullmann_80, ullmann_81, ullmann_82, ullmann_83}. This coordination phenomena provides a feasible 
possibility that the formation of carbon--metal intermediates in surface Ullmann coupling can directly make use of \emph{pre-existing} adatoms.
Thus, it can be naturally derived that there is a competition between \emph{ideal-surface} atoms and \emph{adatoms} which actually take part in the structure of intermediates in Ullmann coupling. Also if it is \emph{ideal-surface} atoms that comprise intermediates, these \emph{ideal-surface} atoms can also be fully extracted out from the first layer and become \emph{extracted adatoms}, which can be regarded as an approach to create adatoms on metal surface.
The details of the these arguments are discussed in following sections.

\subsubsection{Dehalogenation}

Evidences have already been presented that metal adatoms participate in the process of dehalogenation. 
In 2017, Barton \textit{et al.}~\cite{chemeurope2017} explored the role of adatoms in the dehalogenation step with iodobenzene on Au(111), Ag(111) and Cu(111) surface based on DFT calculations. The energy profile of adatom formation on pristine surface was compared with the profile of formation on surface with the presence of iodobenzene, the latter case is referred to as adatom formation of $origin(2)$. The comparison has shown that the energy of extracting a metal atom from the pristine surface was in the 1.12 - 1.71~eV range. While in the dehalogenation step, the dehalogenated iodobenzene would interact with the metal atom of $nature(1)$ on metal surface, which would possibly form a new adatom of $origin(2)$. This step required a dramatically lower energy of 0.16-0.60~eV range. Furthermore, the calculations have shown that the energy released in the process of adsorption of idobenzene on metal surface and formation of organometallic intermediates in the process of surface Ullmann coupling is sufficient to compensate the energy required for a metal atom extraction to form a new adatom of $origin(2)$, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:3}.
\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.75\columnwidth]{Fig/Adatom-formation.png}
\caption{Graphical comparison of the energetics of the adatom formation without adsorbate (top half) to the extraction by aryl–halide process (lower half).Values for Cu are shown in red, for Ag in green and for Au in blue. The extraction-by-arylhalide process starts from the dissociated iodobenzene. Dotted lines indicate parts of the energy profile that have not been quantitatively resolved.}
\label{fig:3}
\end{figure}

It is clear that metal atoms of $nature(1)$ have a great chance to participate in dehalogenation, the first step of surface Ullmann coupling. And the construction of organometallic intermediate in the dehalogenation could possibly be a feasible pathway to form adatom of $origin(2)$. Metal atoms of $nature(2)$ in the dehalogenation had few related reports to date.

{\color{blue}

A multitude of evidences have been presented that metal atoms will participate in dehalogenation as discussed in above section. However, it is still unclear whether \emph{ideal-surface} atoms or \emph{adatoms} are involved in this process. DFT calculations demonstrated that dehalogenation, as the first step of Ullmann coupling, has possibility to originate an absolute new adatom by fully extracting an \emph{ideal-surface} atom out from the first layer~\cite{chemeurope2017}. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:3}, formation of an adatom on ideal, perfect Cu(111), Ag(111) and Au(111) surface require \SI{1.71}{\electronvolt}, \SI{1.12}{\electronvolt} and \SI{1.15}{\electronvolt} respectively. Dehalogenation of iodobenzene will result in phenyl-metal species, this interaction will decrease the full extraction of \emph{ideal-surface} atom by \SI{1.07}{\electronvolt}, \SI{0.72}{\electronvolt} and \SI{0.99}{\electronvolt} on Cu(111), Ag(111) and Au(111) surface, respectively. The significant reduction in energy indicates that a new adatom can probably be created from an \emph{ideal-surface} atom by organometallic intermediates produced in dehalogenation. 

But it has also been reported that the interaction between single phenyl groups and copper atoms are not adequate enough to fully extract an \emph{ideal-surface} atom out. These phenyl groups produced after dehalogenation will start to diffuse on Cu(111) surface and interact with different \emph{ideal-surface} atoms to form organometallic intermediates~\cite{pccp2010} while all \emph{ideal-surface} atoms involved will stay on their original locations after diffusion.

Till now it can be concluded that dehalogenation lowers the energy required for creation of adatoms from \emph{ideal-surface} atoms on a metal surface. The direct use of \emph{pre-existing} adatoms should ideally cut down the energy needed for this step compared to \emph{ideal-surface} atoms. However, few work has been related to \emph{pre-existing} adatoms in dehalogenation.

}


\subsubsection{Diffusion}

The diffusion process is involved in the interaction between single precursor group and metal atom. 
In 2018, Nagoya \textit{et al.}~\cite{jpcc2018} investigated the mechanism of Ullmann coupling of 7,10-dibromofluoranthene (Br$_{2}$FL) on Au(111) via DFT calculations. Compared to simple phenyl rings that tend to form ~$36^\circ$ tilt angle with Cu(111) surface~\cite{pccp2010}, the monobromo FL with one Br atom removed would stay almost parallel to Au(111) surface due to steric repulsion between the large backbone of BrFL group and the substrate. And BrFL group was found to lift surface Au atom out by 1.9 \AA\ from its initial position, which is much larger than 0.16 \AA\ height lifted by a simpole phenyl ring, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:diff}.
Ebeling \textit{et al.}~\cite{acsnano2019} also indicated 4-bromo-3$^{''}$-iodo-$p$-terphenyl group interacts with the Cu atom inside the surface, and would partially lift the Cu atom out from the surface while diffusing on Cu(111) surface. 
\begin{figure}[hbt]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.75\columnwidth]{Fig/Diffusion_path.png}
\caption{Top and side view of the initial, transition and final geometries of BrFL molecule diffuse.}
\label{fig:diff}
\end{figure}

Metal atoms of $nature(1)$ were proven to play a significant role in the diffusion of dehalogenated phenyl groups, the metal atoms that interact with phenly groups will be partially lifted from its original position, the lifting height is affected by the intensity of interaction between the phenyl group and metal atom. Formation of adatom of $origin(2)$ has not been reported in diffusion, which indicates that the interaction between phenyl group and metal atom in this step is not in the magnitude to fully extract a metal atom of $nature(1)$. 

{\color{blue}

There were no apparent proof that diffusion of dehalogenated species on metal surface can form new adatoms from \emph{ideal-surface} atoms. Most reports were focused on the interaction between the dehalogenated intermediates with \emph{ideal-surface} atoms in diffusion process. The magnitude of this type of interaction is determined by the geometry of intermediates and type of metal atoms.

For single phenyl groups diffusing on Cu(111), it will form \SI{36}{\degree} tile angle with respect to the surface, and the ring structure will flip when it moves between two adjacent copper atoms. Phenly group will lift the \emph{ideal-surface} copper atom by \SI{0.16}{\angstrom} from its original position in diffusion~\cite{pccp2010}. When it comes to the bromofluoranthene molecule diffuse on Au(111) surface, DFT calculation reveals that this aryl group will stay almost parallel to the surface~\cite{jpcc2018}. And the \emph{ideal-surface} gold atom will raise up to \SI{1.9}{\angstrom} from the first layer, \SI{1.74}{\angstrom} higher than phenyl-cooper, owing to the stronger interaction between bromofluoranthene and gold atom.

Whether \emph{pre-existing} adatoms are involved in this step is rarely reported. It can be concluded that diffusion of aryl groups on metal surface can seldom create adatoms since the intensity of interaction between these single dehalogenated species and metal atoms is not sufficient to fully extract \emph{ideal-surface} atoms out.

}

\subsubsection{Formation of C--M--C structure intermediates} \label{sec:dimerized-adatom}

The nature of the metal atoms in dimerized organometallic intermediate has been investigated through multiple approaches. Besides, it can be deduced that an metal atom of $nature(2)$, which is also an adatom of $origin(1)$ will exit above the first layer of surface before the surface Ullmann coupling reacion occurs. And this atom can attract two phenyl groups diffuse close to it and form the dimerized organometallic intermediate in this step. This type of formation might require less energy compared to the situation that two phenyl groups both interact with the same metal atom of $nature(1)$. The arguments on the nature and origin of metal atoms in this step are intense in the mechanism of surface Ullmann coupling.

In 2017, Zint \textit{et al.}~\cite{acsnano2017} analyzed structures of intermediates in the polymerization of bromotriphenylene to bistriphenylene on Cu(111) surface using STM, AFM image and DFT calculations. Two computational models were compared: two triphenylene molecules bonded to an fully-out-of-surface adatom (a metal atom of $nature(2)$) and two precursors bonded to an atom partially lifted from Cu surface (a metal atom of $nature(1)$) as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:5}. It has been concluded that the structures observed in AFM were more consistent with computational adatom ($nature(2)$) models. In particular, the C--C distance in organometallic intermediate was of 3.9 \AA\ measured by AFM, which was closer to the Cu adatom ($nature(2)$) model (3.86 \AA) compared to the partially-lifted Cu atom ($nature(1)$) model (3.42 \AA). Furthermore, the energy for formation of the adatom-containing intermediate from distant precursors was 1.74~eV lower than that of the intermediate with a partially lifted atoms.

\label{fig:5}
\end{figure}

%%ZHZH Dima suggests partial lifting should be discussed separately.
The origin the adatoms were later explored after the metal atoms in dimerized organometallic intermediates were proven to be of $nature(2)$, which is an adatom on surface. In 2019, the study of 4‐Bromo-3$^{''}$- iodo‐$p$‐terphenyl coupling on Cu(111), proved again that the Cu atoms in dimerized organometallic intermediates were adatoms (metal atoms of $nature(2)$) compared experiments with simulated AFM image[Fig.~\ref{fig:6}~\cite{acsnano2019}]. It was further suggested that these adatoms are generated by the extraction of two close single precursor groups (adatom of $origin(2)$), instead of pre-exsiting adatoms (adatoms of $origin(1)$) from a statistic study of all intermediates species in the surface Ullmann coupling.

The STM image of the unlinked dimer reveals a dark region between the two molecules that separates them.

\label{fig:6}
\end{figure}

The nature of metal atoms in dimerized organometallic intermediates has been proven to be an adatom. And further the origin of this adatom is of $origin(2)$, which indicates before the surface Ullmann coupling reaction occurs, the adatom is still a metal atom of $nature(1)$, stay in the first layer of metal surface. After it was selected from two phenyl groups in coupling procedure, it will be fully lifted out of the surface, become a new adatoms. The effect of metal atom in the last step --- formation of C--C bond was not investigated intensive compared to previous steps.

%In addition, chlorinated prophyrin as precursor has also been deposited on Cu(111)~\cite{chematerial2019}. Based on DFT calculations, the Cu adatom mediated path is 3~eV lower than the direct dechlorination. And from STM image, some precursors are still intact at temperature of 400~K, which should be already dehalogenated at lower temperature. It proves that the Cu adatoms are the limiting agent [Fig.~\ref{fig:prophyrin}].

{\color{blue}
The mechanism of metal atoms participating in the formation of C--M--C bridges structure are most intensively investigated among all other steps in surface Ullmann coupling. Multiple approaches have been used to figure out it is \emph{adatoms} or \emph{ideal surface} atoms that actually constitute the C--M--C bridge. 

DFT calculation results state that two phenyl groups, after diffusing to adjacent position, will bind to the same \emph{ideal surface} copper atom and form C--Cu--C structure on Cu(111)~\cite{pccp2010}. Similar structure will be constructed on Ag(111) and Au(111) surface from phenyls and \emph{ideal surface} silver and gold atoms.

However, disagreement has been proposed with other precursors. Fig.~\ref{fig:5} describes the C--Cu--C structure formed by two triphenylene groups with a copper atom on Cu(111) surface using AFM and DFT methods~\cite{acsnano2017}. Two distinct simulation models are shown: (1) the copper atom in C--Cu--C structure comes from \emph{ideal surface} atom as shown in (c) and (d). This \emph{ideal surface} atom is partially lifted up from its original position in the first layer of metal; and (2) the copper atom in C--Cu--C is an \emph{adatom} as pictured in (e) and (f). Two model are compared with AFM image on atomic properties. The distance between carbon and carbon in this C--Cu--C bridge in AFM, \emph{ideal surface} model and \emph{adatom} model are \SI{3.90}{\angstrom}, \SI{3.42}{\angstrom} and \SI{3.86}{\angstrom} respectively, which proves that the \emph{adatom} model is more consistent with the molecule geometry in experiment. In addition, the energy required to form the C--Cu--C bridge structure from these precursors with \emph{adatom} is estimated to be \SI{1.74}{\electronvolt} lower than with \emph{ideal surface} atom. The metal atoms in C--M--C intermediate structure were proven to be adatoms with clear evidence for the first time. Then the pathway of emerging such adatoms was also reported.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:6}, the STM and simulated AFM image of forming C--Cu--C intermediate structure from 4‐bromoterphenyl and copper atom are displayed~\cite{acsnano2019}. Based on the comparison of the experimental STM and simulated AFM image data, the metal atom participated in the C--Cu--C structure is again, proven to be adatoms. Furthermore, these adatoms, according to the statistic data, are created during the surface Ullmann coupling reaction by extracting the \emph{ideal surface} atoms out instead of \emph{pre-existing} adatoms before the coupling process.

In this step, the confusion on the origin of metal atoms is approaching to be clear. Previously works suggest that the metal atoms in C--M--C intermediate structures are most likely to be adatoms. And the formation of such a bridge structure is expected to be a feasible strategy to create adatoms on Cu(111) surface. However, as discussed in former section, the intensity of interaction between aryl groups and metal atoms will be determined both by the molecule geometry of aryl group as well as the type of metal atoms. Whether surface Ullmann coupling of all possible precursors on different surfaces will obey the same mechanism still remains adequate space for further exploration and discussion.

The  effect  of  metal  atoms  in  the  last  step  —  formation of C--C bond was not investigated widely compared to previous steps.

\subsection{Computational Details}

%RZK: learn how to use si package and correct all units here.
The periodic density functional theory calculations were performed using the Perdew–Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) for the exchange-correlation functional, the projector augmented wave method for the ion-core electron interactions, and a plane-wave basis set as implemented in the Vienna ab-initio simulation package (VASP) code. Van der Waals (vdW) interactions were included using the DFT-D3 method to describe the nonlocal correlation energy. 

The Cu(111) surface used in all surface Ullmann coupling was 
modeled by a four-layered slab consisting of 192 Cu atoms (a p($48\times 4$) unit cell) and at least 15~\AA of vacuum. The relaxations were performed with applying spin-polarization. The energy cut-off for the plane-wave basis was set to 800 eV and a $3\times 3 \times1$ k-mesh was adopted. The mesh density of k points was kept fixed in related calculations with primitive cells. All atoms were fully relaxed until the MAX force on the atom was less than $2\times 10^{-2} eV/\si{\angstrom}^{2}$. 

Transition-state calculations were carried out using a Climbing-Image Nudged Elastic Band (CI-NEB) methods with VTST code\cite{ullmann_59}. An improved initial guess~\cite{ullmann_60} for minimum energy path was conducted in CI-NEB calculation, different number of intermediates were interpolated between the initial and final configurations due to the distance between them. Plus, All atoms were fully relaxed until the MAX force on the atom was less than 0.1~\si{\eV\square\angstrom} in CI-NEB calculations.

Generally the value of most thermodynamic functions can be derived from our DFT optimization results. 
(%ZZ1215: still miss the math part, will add later)

The simulation of surface Ullmann coupling reaction was conducted with chlorobenzene, bromobenzene and iodobenzene on Cu(111) surface. We explored the mechanism discussed above step by step including the least reported step --- formation of C--C bond.

In the dehalogenation step, the CI-NEB method was used in chlorobenzene, bromobenzene and iodobenzene precursors to study how different halogens will affect on the dissociation of carbon-halogen bonds. CI-NEB method offered us energy profile diagram as well the transition state.

%RZK1223: Numbers from previous calculations. What computational methods have been used before?


\subsection{Dehalogenation}

%RZK1223: We do not seem to need this energy at this point.
%(In the literature, they mentioned that in the gas phase, the dissociation reaction are highly endothermic (3.85 eV for bromobenzene and 3.33 eV for iodobenzene), we can get the energy for this reaction too)

Fig.~\ref{fig:dissociation_Cl}, Fig.~\ref{fig:dissociation_Br} and Fig.~\ref{fig:dissociation_I} shows the initial, transition and final states (notated as IM1, TS1 and IM2 in Fig.~\ref{fig:completeenergy}, respectively) of chlorobenzene, bromobenzene and iodobenzene dehalogenation on Cu(111), respectively. 

RZK: First state reaction energies. Negative energies already mean that the reaction is exothermic, there is no need to state this.

Dehalogenation reactions of three precursors are all exothermic, which in reverse, are endothermic in gas phase according to the DFT calculated energies. This is due to the formation of energetically unstable radical in gas phase, but copper surface can donate electrons to stable these intermediate species.
%R1111: Do you mean our calculated enthalpies or experimental values? (%ZZ: add descriptions)
%R1111: Why your state lalbels (IM2, IM1) disagree with those in the final energy profile?(%ZZ: changed)
The energy change ($\Delta E$ = $E_{IM2} - E_{IM1}$) of dehalogenation of chlorobenzene, bromobenzene and iodobenzene on Cu(111) are -0.58 eV, -0.8 eV and -0.94 eV, respectively. As seen from the Figures~\ref{fig:dissociation_Cl}--\ref{fig:dissociation_I}, the halogens always occupy the hollow site of Cu(111) surface after the carbon-halogen bond (C-X) is broken. 
%R1111: Physisorption must be described before dissociation. Negative, not positive adsorption energies must be used
In IM1, the precursor molecule was physisorbed by the surface, the adsorption energy are 1.06 eV, 1.18 eV and 1.37 eV, respectively for chlorobenzene, bromobenzene and iodobenzene. (%ZZ: added)
%
In the TS1, the geometry of chlorobenzene, bromobenzene and iodobenzene on Cu(111) are similar, forming a tilt angle, ready for the break of C-X, the distance of C-X are 2.18 \AA\, 2.46 \AA\ and 2.61 \AA\, respectively. 
%R1111: Report bond elongations, not only bond lengths.
After dehalogenation, the phenyl species and halogen atoms were separately chemisorbed by Cu(111) surface. In IM2, the distance between the carbon and halogen are increased by 1.81 \AA\, 1.64 \AA\ and 2.49 \AA\ compared to original distance, respectively. The geometry of IM2 for chlorobenzene, bromobenzene are similar, in which the phenyl species displayed a more tilt angle with the copper surface compared to the TS1. 
%R1111: Compare you results to Ph-I in barton2017fromation (Figure5-Cu_IS in their article). They do not have vertical position for the phenyl.  (%ZZ: recalculated, the first time still vertical, try to change to initial geometry)
However, In the TS1 of iodobenzene, the phenyl specie is almost vertical to the copper surface. This makes a contribution to the highest enthalpy of iodobenzene dehalogenation. Another reason why iodobenzene possesses the highest enthalpy may come from the strongest chemisorption of Iodine on Copper. 
%R1111: Do we want to perform additional calculations to figure out the reason? Perhaps not now. (%ZZ: agree)

%R1111: The first sentence is trivial and must be removed. Do not define energy barrier in Results section. This definition is trivial and can be omitted.
Secondly, the $E_{barrier}$ ($E_{barrier} = E_{TS1} - E_{IM1}$) for three halogenation reaction were also computed and summarized, which are 1.25 eV, 0.92 eV and 0.68 eV, for C-Cl, C-Br and C-I respectively. These $E_{barrier}$ values indicate that the carbon-iodine bond is the easiest to break on Cu(111) surface while the carbon-chlorine bond is the hardest. This is consistent with the experimental data that most carbon-iodine and carbon-bromine bonds will dissociate at room temperature, but an higher temperature is required to break carbon-chlorine bonds in surface Ullmann coupling. The $\Delta E$ and $E_{barrier}$ were also computed in Björk's ~\cite{jacs2013} work. $\Delta E$ were -0.70 eV and -0.82 eV and  $E_{barrier}$ were 0.72 eV and 0.40 eVfor bromobenzene and iodobenzene on Cu(111). Trends are the same with our results, the difference between specific values may come from their use of different functional (optB86b) and the size of slab (four layers 6x6).

%R1111: Some of these findings have been reported in the literature before. Comparison to previous calculations is necessary. "Trends are the same but numbers differ. Why? Do they use the same XC functional, basis set?" (%ZZ: added)

Summarizing the dehalogenation results, the reaction mechanism of chlorobenzene, bromobenzene and iodobenzene are very comparable on Cu(111) surface, the geometry of TS1 are analogous. The phenyl species of chlorobenzene, bromobenzene form a tilt angle with Cu(111) surface and it is vertical for iodobenzene. The dehalogenation of iodobenzene is the easiest among these three reactions due to the lowest activation energy.

\subsection{Diffusion and Formation of Dimerized Organometallic Intermediates}

%R1111: do not use "would". State facts with certainty. "To for a C--C bond the diffusion MUST brings two phenyl groups together." (%ZZ: ok)
After the dehalogenation, the diffusion of all species on copper surface must bring two orientation-matched phenyl groups together, leading to the formation of dimerized organometallic intermediates. Since the halogens such as chlorine, bromine and iodine have been dehalogenated and then chemisorbed by the surface, these three different precursors can be fairly considered to form the same dimerized organometallic intermediate structure in this step.

Fig.~\ref{fig:organometallicintermediate} shows the optimized geometry of dimerized organometallic intermediate on Cu(111) surface. From the left picture, it is apparent that these two phenyl groups both conducted interactions with the copper atom on Cu(111) surface; from the right side, it shows that, the copper atom that interacted with two phenyl groups is partially lifted from the first layer flat. This metal atom belongs to $nature(1)$. And this phenomenon does not take place when there is only one phenyl group since the interaction is not strong enough. 

%R1111: Why chlorobenzene is so different? Halogen does not participate in this step at all. How come that the reaction energy is so different?
Besides, the energy change of the reaction for three precursors from dehalogenated chlorobenzene, bromobenzene and iodobenzene to dimerized organometallic intermediate are +1.40 eV, +0.17 eV and +0.17 eV, respectively. These three reactions are all endothermic, and the dehalogenated chlorobenzene will adsorb the most energy, which is consistent with the experiment that transformation to dimerized organometallic intermediates from dichlorobenzenes wound not be completed unless a higher temperature is present, but transformation of dibromobenzenes and diiodobenzenes would fulfill at room temperature.

%R1111: It looks like this unfinished paragraph belongs to the next subsection: formation of the C--C bond.
Here, we considered that the dimerized organometallic intermediates were formed with the copper atom of $nature(1)$. In reality, the copper atom in organometallic intermediates may also come from the adatom which is of $nature(2)$. It will lay above the surface before the coupling reaction occurs. In this case -----

%R1111: This intermediate is shown in the figure for the C--C bond formation. Remove this figure, re-reference.

\subsection{Formation of Carbon Carbon (C--C) Bond}

The final coupling step is the formation of carbon carbon bond (C--C). As discussed above, we explored the two pathways of the C--C bond formation starting from  the Cu atom partially lifted from the surface by two phenyl groups. In the first pathway (Path~1), the Cu atom returns back to its original position in the first surface layer once the C-C bond is formed without producing an adatom. In the secind pathway (Path~2), the Cu atom is pulled out from its original position to become an adatom and leaving the vacancy in its original position. %This means that the metal atom is of $nature(1)$ at the beginning of surface Ullmann coupling, and in the end it changes to $nature(2)$ through the $origin(2)$ method, becoming a new adatom on metal surface.
Here, we investigated two possibilities separately.

\subsubsection{Path I: Cu Returns to Original Location after Coupling Reaction}

%R1111: LATER. We need to develop better notation for all chemical species and refer to them consistently.
%R1111: comparison to existing calculations. Comparison between different metals (and halogens?) in our own calculations.
In Path I, the formation of C--C bond started from the dimerized organometallic intermediate in which the copper atom was partially lifted (notated as $IS_{path1}$). Then the two carbons which would construct a new bond later slope closer to each other, while the copper atom was less lifted on the surface (notated as $TS_{path1}$). Finally, a new C-C bond was formed and the surface went back to original configuration, no adatom forms after the coupling reaction finished (notated as $FS_{path1}$).

%In Fig.~\ref{fig:bondformlift}, along the potential energy surface, 6 intermediates were interpolated between $IS_{path1}$ and $FS_{path1}$. The tilt angle of phenyl species in respect to the Cu(111) surface was $50^\circ$ in $IS_{path1}$ and flattened to $35^\circ$ in $TS_{path1}$ and ended at $0^\circ$ in $FS_{path1}$. The distance between the two carbon atoms which would construct a bond varied from 3.10~\si{\angstrom} to 2.28 \AA\ and ended at 1.49 \AA\.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:bondformlift}, along the potential energy surface, 6 intermediates were interpolated between $IS_{path1}$ and $FS_{path1}$. The tilt angle of phenyl species in respect to the Cu(111) surface was 50\si{\celsius} in $IS_{path1}$ and flattened to $35^\circ$ in $TS_{path1}$ and ended at $0^\circ$ in $FS_{path1}$. The distance between the two carbon atoms which would construct a bond varied from 3.10~\si{\angstrom} to 2.28~\si{\angstrom} and ended at 1.49~\si{\angstrom}.

Path I reaction is exothermic, the enthalpy $\Delta H$ is -2.00~\si{\eV}, and $E_{barrier}$ is 0.50 eV.
%R1111: This results agree with the computational study of the C--C formation of dibromobenzene species. Reference.

%R1111: LATER. It is important to discuss the zero-energy for this step. Would it be more informative to use a common zero from the entire energy profile?

\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{Fig/bondformlift.png}
\caption{C-C bond formation through lifting Cu atom Path I}
\label{fig:bondformlift}
\end{figure*}


\subsubsection{Path II: Cu becomes a new adatom after coupling reaction}

In Path II, the process started from the organometallic intermediate whereh the copper atom is fully pulled out as an adatom (notated as $IS_{path2}$) (here we created a vacancy on surface corresponding to the creation of adatom, to assure the whole system has the same number of atoms). Then the two phenyl groups would be lifted higher and closer to each other, while the copper atom is less lifted and move towards a hollow site on the surface(notated as $TS_{path2}$). Finally, a new C-C bond is formed and a new adatom and a new vacancy are created on the surface (notated as $FS_{path2}$).

As Fig.~\ref{fig:bondformadatom} show, in this path, 10 intermediates were interpolated between $IS_{path2}$ and $FS_{path2}$.The tilt angle of phenyl species in respect to the Cu(111) surface initialized at $8.5^\circ$ and $12.2^\circ$ in $IS_{path2}$ (the difference angle could be accounted by the fact that vacancy is close the one phenyl species, this will affect a little on the tilt angle), then flattened to nearly $0^\circ$ in $TS_{path2}$ and ended at $-9.1^\circ$ in $FS_{path2}$ (the negative angle arises from the fact that the adatom is right behind the biphenyl). The distance between the two carbons which would construct a bond varied from 3.89 \AA\ to 2.53 \AA\ and ended at 1.50 \AA\ .

Path II reaction is slightly exothermic, the enthalpy $\Delta H$ is -0.17 eV, and $E_{barrier}$ is 2.00 eV, higher than the $E_{barrier}$ of Path I.

\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{Fig/bondformadatom.png}
\caption{C-C bond formation through new formed adatom Path II}
\label{fig:bondformadatom}
\end{figure*}

%R1111: All titles and subtitles use sentence case, meaning only the first word is capitalized.
\subsubsection{Path I vs path II}

Taking the data of Path I and Path II into consideration, finally, a feasible C--C bond was constructed in both cases (bond length is around 1.5 \AA\, expected to be 1.34 \AA\ - 1.54 \AA). From thermodynamic aspect, Path I is much more exothermic, which means it will lead to a more stable product. Kinetically, the activation energy of Path I is also smaller than Path II, which means at the same temperature, the Path I reaction would take place at a higher speed and account for a much larger percentage. In this case, we could safely conclude that, if there is no pre-exiting adatom on copper surface, the formation of C--C bond in surface Ullmann coupling will follow the path I.

%R1111: Compare C--C distance in IM4 and IM5 to the experimental data for Ph-Halogen. Can we see IM5 experimentally? 3.89Ang vs 3.1Ang.


%R1111: Note that the difference between dimer1 and dimer2 is smaller than the difference between FS1 and IS. Probably because the dimer interacts stronger with the adatom than with the surface. 


\subsection{Energy diagram of complete Surface Ullmann Coupling Reaction}

In this section, the summary of thermodynamic data of all intermediates in surface Ullmann coupling reaction is present in one diagram. As is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:completeenergy}.

Here taking the surface Ullmann coupling between two bromobenzene as example, the physisorption of two bromobenzene on Cu(111) surface decrease the energy of the whole system by 2.35 eV, which is widely recognized in experiment because adsorbing aromatic species on copper surface as a fast procedure. 
Then till the formation of new C--C bond, a detailed discussion has been demonstrated in previous sections. The last two successive steps are concerned with the desorption of biphenyl molecule and two dehalogenated bromine atoms. 
In total, the red line is more energetically favourable than green line, that can be considered to be a more reasonable pathway in realistic surface Ullmann coupling if there is no pre-exiting adatom on metal surface.

%%% Early steps
%R1111: LATER. Do we need adatom calculations for TS1? Perhaps only one or two halogen-metal pairs (for complete diagram). How will it affect the subsequent steps? Will the PH-Adatom roam the surface together before encountering the second Ph? PRIORITY6.
%R1111: Why there is no Cu-atom lifting during the C-X bond dissociation? Compare to previous works. Actually partial lifting is a process with a barrier for Au and Ag surfaces but not for Cu. We might need to reproduce this after all. --> More comparison to the existing calculation is required.

%%% Late steps
%R1111: Is the later part of the diagram halogen independent? YES!
%R1111: The barrier between IM4 and IM5 is important. Because it seems that it exists when the adatom is pulled by the R-X dissociation. PRIORITY2. Use NEB to find it.
%R1111: We need free energy for the important IM4->IM5 step. This will include increased entropy of the adatom-vacancy system (assuming that the atom with two phenyls diffuse freely). PRIORITY4.
%R1111: What is the energy of the state after dimer1, when the dimer "falls" flat to the surface? It should be around -3.97 eV. dimer1-2: dimer2+fs1-IS-IS=-3.97 eV
%R1111: An alternative TS2-1 must be calculated. The final product should be lying flat on the surface. PRIORITY3.
%R1111: What effect is responsible for the energy lowering upon adatom creation in IM5? Note that for I--Ph on Cu the extraction+diffusion during the C-I breaking step produces the overall uphill step. PRIORITY1. Remove Ph in IM3, IM4, IM without geometry relaxation (only the metal surface, not phenyl).

%%% Minor comments
%R1111: State labeling is poorly planned. Relabel states to stick to one system.
%R1111: Should we add one more TS between IM2 and IM3? LATER.
%R1111: How does the vacancy affect the energy? LATER.
%R1111: Halogen filling the vacancy or sitting on top of the adatom? PRIORITY5.

%RZK1222: This important effect needs to be properly described. The height of TS2-1 means that IM5, once formed will not undergo the C--C bond formation and can be viewed as an undesirable by-product of the reaction (unless it exists in quick equilibrium with IM4, which can be entropically hindered -- hard to find that vacancy again).

%RZK1222: How difficult is it to push the adatom (with attached organic radicals) DOWN?

\label{fig:completeenergy}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Formation of Adatom on Pure Cu Surface}

Finally, the energy of forming an adatom on a perfect Cu(111) surface is also presented. The goal of showing this energy diagram is to launch a comparison between two different conditions, both of which deliver an adatom on Cu(111) surface. One is the formation without any species on metal surface, the other one is with surface Ullmann coupling reaction.
As Figure.~\ref{fig:pureadatomform} shows, the reaction of forming a new adatom-vacancy pair on perfect Cu(111) surface is endothermic, $\Delta H$ is 1.76 eV and the $E_{barrier}$ is 2 eV. This means at room temperature, the formation of adatom is unfavourable. 
However, as is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:completeenergy}, the presence of organometallic intermediate in surface Ullmann coupling could promote the formation of adatoms on surface both thermodynamically and kinetically. This pathway might be considered as a plausible method to create adatoms on metal surface.
